Sometimes it felt like we had no points, and other times Damned Sorceress lived. The ratios sorta worked out, despite the awful looking provision curve, in large part due to the tutors. Roach, Knickers, ADC, and Decree all cost provisions while not costing you one of your 16 plays for the game. These types of cards are really important to making a Nova deck make sense, otherwise you just end every game with a bunch of leftover provisions in the deck. <br /><br />Decklist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.playgwent.com/decks/3c6aab4b2908275e45b2573ae29fd166">http://www.playgwent.com/decks/3c6aab4b2908275e45b2573ae29fd166</a><br /><br />00:00:00 Inspired Zeal<br />00:08:50 Reckless Flurry<br />00:20:48 Imprisonment<br />00:28:48 Tactical Decision<br />00:37:27 Invigorate<br />00:47:19 Carapace{% endraw %}
