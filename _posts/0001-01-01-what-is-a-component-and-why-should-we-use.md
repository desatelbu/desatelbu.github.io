{% raw %}As you gain experience with procedural coding in PHP, you notice that there are tasks which are performed in a routine fashion and a lot of code which can be simply reused. What if you can save your time on these points using some of the existing PHP development frameworks and/or content management systems which allows MVC architecture and object oriented programming concepts to follow at ease for you?<br /><br />In this beginner webinar on the topic, I would cover a quick introduction of content management system with focus on PHP based content management system &quot;Joomla&quot;. Joomla is considered as dynamic portal engine and content management system, and allows you to develop variety of systems from website, ecommerce store to a complex social network with the help of pre-built features i.e. caching, content management, web services, templates, and more.<br /><br />The real power of Joomla lies in the scalability which can be achieved with the use of custom extensions which include templates, language files, plugins, modules and components. This webinar would further cover quick hands on workshop to download and setup Joomla on a demo server, and developing a simple module and component for Joomla version 2.5.{% endraw %}
