This suggests that black tea may play a role in lowering the diabetes risk factors. Other types of drinks like green and white teas have also shown to have similar effects. The studies are not conclusive but they open the door for more research into the subject of how to prevent diabetes.<br /><br />Black tea is a type of tea that is more oxidized than oolong, green and white teas. All four types are made from leaves of the shrub (or small tree) Camellia sinensis. Black tea is generally stronger in flavor than the less oxidized teas. Two principal varieties of the species are used -- the small-leaved Chinese variety plant (C. sinensis subsp. sinensis), used for most other types of teas, and the large-leaved Assamese plant (C. sinensis subsp. assamica), which was traditionally mainly used for black tea, although in recent years some green and white have been produced.{% endraw %}
