And without even holding a degree, from congress party Rajiv Gandhi was made the Prime Minister of India. Wondering How? Aren't there Any laws which state that education qualification is required/ or not required for any ministers? But then why is a graduation degree required to become an IAS or IPS officer? Where these officers don't even hold enough power in their hands as compared to the ministers. Well...all of these questions would be rightfully answered in today's video.{% endraw %}
