{% raw %}Okay, so provisioning may be just a fancy word for shopping but we're on a yacht so I'll run with it. In this video I'll walk you through who pays for all the food, where we buy it and the logistics behind feeding a small army of crew &amp; guests. Bon Appetit! <br /><br />Big thanks to Julian at La Boutique Foodland for letting me feature his shop and all the amazing produce he sources.<br />See more @foodlandsbh <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.foodlandsbh.com/">https://www.foodlandsbh.com/</a><br /><br />Be sure to go follow @jaredwatney who has an incredible channel with all things yachting! <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/jaredwatney">https://www.youtube.com/c/jaredwatney</a>{% endraw %}
