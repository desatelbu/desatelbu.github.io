{% raw %}As the Museum's hundreds of millions of archival documents attest, the Holocaust is the best documented case of genocide: The US military and allies collected firsthand evidence. Survivors and other eyewitnesses testified about their personal experiences. And the Nazis kept meticulous records.<br /><br />Yet people always have attempted to distort the history or flat-out deny it, for a variety of reasons. Countries minimize or ignore the part played by local collaborators in order to rehabilitate their images. Deniers quickly spread misinformation through the power of social media. And as the history recedes in time, new generations are susceptible to the dangers of manipulation.<br /><br />Speaker<br />Dr. Robert Williams, Deputy Director, International Affairs, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum<br /><br />Expert Commentary<br />Gideon Taylor, President, Claims Conference (Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany)<br /><br />Moderator<br />Dr. Edna Friedberg, Historian, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum{% endraw %}
