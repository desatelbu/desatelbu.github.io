{% raw %}#ShiftingRealities #Howtoshift #Shiftingmotivation #Shiftingmethods<br /><br />Hello everyone! I'm back with another video about Reality Shifting! (and how to shift realities)<br />I saw it on TikTok a while back and have been doing research ever since. Along the way, I've noticed all the misinfo spreading so I thought it'd be an excellent idea to make a video about it (yk shifting methods, and how shifting works etc). A lot of people are trying to shift realities to Hogwarts, shift to anime etc as we speak so I'm here to help!!!<br />(It's also a pretty hot topic lately so I decided to jump on and share what I know ehehe)<br /><br />If you have any questions feel free to comment. If you just wanna comment and say hi that's okay too! I love talking to people :D<br /><br />For next week's video I'm going to be talking about the spooky Elevator Game which can supposedly send you to another world, should you complete the instructions correctly.... stay tuned!<br /><br />Find my socials on my Linktree!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://linktr.ee/Kristeau">https://linktr.ee/Kristeau</a><br /><br />(in case you can't access the links ^^ my socials are:<br />TikTok: Kristeauu<br />Instagram: Kristin.kkd)<br /><br />About me:<br />Name: Kristin<br />Age: 18 SO YOUTUBE STOP DISABLING MY COMMENTS YOU MEANIE <br />Location: I liveth in a country in the North (Canada)<br />Current stress: I keep running out of snacks :( <br />Subscriber count: 5'405 (yay so many of you hehe)<br /><br />Hope you all have a wonderful day/night and thank you for watching!!!<br /><br />business inquiries: kristeauu@hotmail.com{% endraw %}
