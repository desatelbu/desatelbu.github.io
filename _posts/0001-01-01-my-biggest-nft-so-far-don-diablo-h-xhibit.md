{% raw %}You can now experience HΞXHIBIT III yourself at Moco Museum, Amsterdam. <br /><br />Don: &quot;I feel so blessed to be able to keep creating and sharing during a time where we are more cut off from society than ever. We are more distanced from each other than ever. For a lot of people digital art and NFT's feel unfamiliar, sometimes even estranging. I wanted to create an art piece that would enhance the emotion and experience of the new digital wave as well as bring people together in these times of segregation&quot;. <br /><br />HΞXHIBIT III is a mixture between a digital art piece and a physical piece. The NFT itself showcases the concept of a mysterious object which looks like a combination between a spaceship and a portal. So why not create the ambitious physical piece in real life? Inside the piece you will get to see a sneak preview of my own personal Metaverse that I have been building these past eighteen months. <br /><br />Max Moore, Head of Contemporary Art Sales, Sotheby’s Hong Kong and Head of Digital Art Sales:<br /><br />“Don Diablo is a pioneering artist in the digital medium, combining the physical and digital to push boundaries and ask us to redefine our conceptions of art. It’s a privilege for Sotheby’s to handle this sale before it’s international exhibition debut.”<br /><br />Although it looks like HΞXHIBIT III could be heading for space in the future, its first stop was the Museum Square in Amsterdam for a free, public installation on the 9th and 10th of December, before beginning an international museum tour starting in Amsterdam.  It's currently on display in the Moco Museum collection alongside signature works from other contemporary artists such as Banksy, Haring, Basquiat and Andy Warhol. <br /><br />After Amsterdam the piece will make its way to Barcelona, London, and Dubai, broadening the exposure of NFT/physical art. The future is NOW! <br /><br />- Don - <br /><br />Special thanks to Northern Lights for helping me bring this vision to life alongside Brandwacht &amp; Meijer, Invent Design, Pinna Acoustics and Media Hologram. The future is bright! <br /><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://northernlight.nl">https://northernlight.nl</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pinna-acoustics.com">https://pinna-acoustics.com</a><br /><br />#NFT #DigitalArt #Metaverse  <br /><br />⬡⬢ Don Diablo ⬢⬡<br />Spotify ⬡ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://Spoti.fi/DonDiablo">http://Spoti.fi/DonDiablo</a><br />Merch ⬡ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://shop.dondiablo.com">http://shop.dondiablo.com</a><br />Instagram ⬡ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/dondiablo">http://instagram.com/dondiablo</a><br />Facebook ⬡ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/OfficialDonDiablo">http://facebook.com/OfficialDonDiablo</a><br />Twitter ⬡ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/dondiablo">http://twitter.com/dondiablo</a><br />YouTube ⬡ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://YouTube.com/DonDiablo?sub_confirmation=1">http://YouTube.com/DonDiablo?sub_confirmation=1</a><br />SoundCloud ⬡ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://soundcloud.com/dondiablo">http://soundcloud.com/dondiablo</a>{% endraw %}
