{% raw %}Ellie Cohanim sits down with Israeli legend and current CEO of the Menachem Begin Heritage Center, Herzl Makov. The two of them go behind the scenes of Israel’s 1981 Iraqi nuclear reactor bombing, Menachem Begin's guiding principles as Prime Minister, Makov’s experience as Chief-of-Staff to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, and how the Begin Doctrine informs Israeli policy on Iran today.{% endraw %}
