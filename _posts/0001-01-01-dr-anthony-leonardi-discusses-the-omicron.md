Dr. Leonardi has written scientific articles on the topic of Long COVID and has continuously raised the alarm about the dangers of COVID-19, warning against all efforts to downplay the severity of the disease. For more information and explanations of some of the scientific topics discussed in the video, read this two-part interview that Dr. Leonardi did last month with Benjamin Mateus.{% endraw %}
