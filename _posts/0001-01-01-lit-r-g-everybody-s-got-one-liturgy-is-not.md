{% raw %}Liturgy is not the property of the Roman Catholic mass. It is simply the order of the elements that comprise a Christian worship service. Some liturgies are more biblical and some are less and some way less. This is going to be the first in a three part series in which Pastor Jason and Elder John from Valley Presbyterian Church in North Hills CA will look at three different orders of worship. Disclaimer - I had to throw together different audio equipment that did not play well together and so there is some noise in the background that I did my best to fix (sorry for the residue). I'll be upping my audio game soon so that I can have more folks in the studio in the new year, Lord willing.<br /><br />To get more teaching  from VPC go here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC80es-jJVmeO5NnE3Xqn1aw">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC80es-jJVmeO5NnE3Xqn1aw</a>{% endraw %}
