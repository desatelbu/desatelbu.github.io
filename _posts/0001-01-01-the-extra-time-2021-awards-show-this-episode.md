Was Harry Kane's botched transfer to Manchester City one of the most embarrassing moments of 2021? Or does the horrific European Super League deserve that title? Were Arsenal the biggest underachievers once more? Or can we simply not look past Barcelona? And does Emmanuel Dennis really deserve to be considered one of the signings of the season? Even more so than Fikayo Tomori to AC Milan? All that, plus much much more, including why mighty David Moyes might just be the manager of the year!<br /><br />► SUBSCRIBE to FOOTBALL DAILY PODCASTS: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2W5ICxU">https://bit.ly/2W5ICxU</a><br />► SPOTIFY: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://spoti.fi/30bG0Q7">https://spoti.fi/30bG0Q7</a><br />► APPLE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://apple.co/2KaVq0K">https://apple.co/2KaVq0K</a>{% endraw %}
