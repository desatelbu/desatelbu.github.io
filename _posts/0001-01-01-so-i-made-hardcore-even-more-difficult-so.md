{% raw %}So I made Hardcore Minecraft EVEN more difficult, and here's what happened... this was hard...<br />TWITCH: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/fundy">https://www.twitch.tv/fundy</a><br />MAIN CHANNEL: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/fundy​">https://www.youtube.com/fundy​</a><br /><br />Editor: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/lewislool">https://twitter.com/lewislool</a><br /><br />Word soup for the beautiful fun great hilarious funny algorithm:<br /><br />In this video, I played on the Dream SMP, except I didnt. This was extreme. I made a challenge / Minecraft, but video, to prank as many Dream SMP members as I could. People such as Fundy, Hbomb, TommyInnit, WilburSoot, <br />Dream, GeorgeNotFound, Sapnap, Nihachu, Tubbo, Quackity, Karl, Eret, etc... <br />Funny thing is though, this actually didn't happen. Instead I played Ultra Hardcore Minecraft, a minecraft difficulty / challenge that makes everything a lot more difficult. Similar to the cursed difficulty or impossible difficulty or babymode difficulty. This was crazy, I really hope you enjoy!{% endraw %}
