{% raw %}String lights?  Edison Bulbs?   Whatever the heck you call em'....   I'm hanging them with the help of a 40V post hole auger, some turnbuckles and a 100lbs of steel and concrete.   Probably a little more complex than it needed to be..... but they do look great!   <br />Thanks for watching and let me know if you have any questions - Joe<br /><br />And I also want to give a big thank you to the Home Depot Prospective and Ryobi Tools for sponsoring this build!   <br /><br />Here are links to the tools I used in this build:<br /><br />RYOBI 18V ONE+â„¢ HP Compact Brushless 2-Tool Kit: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/RYOBI-ONE-HP-18V-Brushless-Cordless-1-2-in-Drill-Driver-and-Impact-Driver-Kit-w-2-2-0-Ah-Batteries-Charger-and-Bag-PBLCK01K/314109290">https://www.homedepot.com/p/RYOBI-ONE-HP-18V-Brushless-Cordless-1-2-in-Drill-Driver-and-Impact-Driver-Kit-w-2-2-0-Ah-Batteries-Charger-and-Bag-PBLCK01K/314109290</a><br /><br /><br />40V HP Brushless Cordless Earth Auger with 8 in.
