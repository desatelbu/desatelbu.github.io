{% raw %}1 + 1 = 3 Proof | Breaking the rules of mathematics.<br />One plus one equals three is possible only by breaking the rules of mathematics. 1+1=3 is not supported by mathematical logic. These strange results may come by the mistake during the calculations. This viral math tricks video is given here to show a message that a single mistake in mathematical calculations can lead to a destructive result. <br /><br /><br />The second part of this video containing how to prove 2+2 = 5. Two plus two equals five is an old mathematical illusion that also proves that a mistake in the calculation can make different results. 2+2=5 viral math problem may puzzle anyone. But if someone carefully watches the 2+2=5 video, there is a mistake in the calculation. The secret of 2+2=5 is hidden in its calculation. The ground rules of mathematics were not followed in 2+2=5 calculations.<br /><br /><br />The third part of this video shows how easy to multiply anything by 11. This fun of mathematics video is intended to show you a message that a simple mistake in mathematical calculations may lead to wrong results. <br />------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Subscribe Matescium: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/c/matescium?sub_confirmation=1">https://youtube.com/c/matescium?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Watch other interesting videos on Matescium<br /><br />Hacking Someoneâ€™s age: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/HW8TQ3JVGmA">https://youtu.be/HW8TQ3JVGmA</a><br />You can solve it within 10 seconds: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/MfeqLjhZAYE">https://youtu.be/MfeqLjhZAYE</a> <br />Mathematics ca prove anything: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/DYDMudoi_mw">https://youtu.be/DYDMudoi_mw</a><br />5 5 5 = 6 How | 6s Challenge | Part 2: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/NbJGLIYA-6A">https://youtu.be/NbJGLIYA-6A</a><br /><br />0 0 0 = 6 How | 6s Challenge: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/io0WIBzx_jU">https://youtu.be/io0WIBzx_jU</a><br />------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Thanks for watching it.<br /><br /><br />#1+1=3 #Mathtricks #Viralmath #1+1=3mathtrick #1+1=3How #1+1=3Proof{% endraw %}
