Many people on reddit WallStreetBets realized the high GME short interest and bought in cheap.  AMC short squeeze was also a potential but did not gain traction until May 2021. GameStop short interest has declined but GME price today remains high thanks to a crowd of GME believers.  AMC stock price reached $72 in late May 2021 and is currently consolidating.  Many AMC apes believe the price of AMC is being manipulated by Citadel and hedge funds.  When will the AMC short squeeze happen?  What is the AMC price target?  Opinions vary but the consensus is soon and to the moon!<br /><br />Small brokers like Robinhood, Webull and Interactive Brokers all stopped Buy orders during the GameStop squeeze in January 2021 due to liquidity issues and the inability to provide capital to the DTCC. In addition they use PFOF (Payment For Order Flow).  Consider using a larger broker like Fidelity to minimize the risk of being shut out during the upcoming AMC short squeeze.{% endraw %}
