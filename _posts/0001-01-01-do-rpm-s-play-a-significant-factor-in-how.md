{% raw %}I have had a few people now try to tell me that reducing loads and shooting gelatin at close range simulating long range can't be accurate because of the RPM differences so I decided to make a video showing drastic RPM differences and the actual effect they play in how bullets perform on impact. In this video the RPM differences are around 35.4% or 80,000 (yes eighty-thousand) RPM's. I'm shooting the 0.224 55 grain Sierra BlitzKing at similar velocities out of 1:14 and a 1:9 twit barrel. <br /><br />This video gives a good visual on just how much of a factor RPM's play.        <br /><br />I had done my research years ago long before ever considering documenting my testing via video and sharing on YouTube when I was testing bullets to make sure they would meet my hunting needs and already knew the answer. I fully trusted the industry experts that I was in contact with telling me that reduced loading is exactly how they test product lines before giving the velocity ratings they give yet there are still many out there that doubt me and the experts so when I realized I had the means to put it to the test I did and here is the video. Please share with all those that put way to much focus on RPM's and their assumptions of RPM's effect.{% endraw %}
