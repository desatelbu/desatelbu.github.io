{% raw %}Changing weather patterns in the Western Australian wheatbelt mean that growers are frequently attempting to sow and establish crops in less-than-favourable conditions. <br /><br />To help overcome this challenge, Latham grower Dylan Hirsch embarked on a deep ripping program in 2016 to aid the early establishment of wheat, barley, canola and lupin crops.<br /><br />Dylan's journey with early crop establishment is featured in the GRDC's 'maximising crop potential in a drying environment' publication, an initiative of the Western Region Regional Cropping Solutions Network.<br /><br />View the publication: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://grdc.com.au/resources-and-publications/all-publications/publications/2019/maximising-crop-potential-in-a-drying-environment">https://grdc.com.au/resources-and-publications/all-publications/publications/2019/maximising-crop-potential-in-a-drying-environment</a>  <br /><br />More info: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://grdc.com.au">https://grdc.com.au</a><br /><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://grdc.com.au/subscribe">https://grdc.com.au/subscribe</a><br /><br />For LIVE Events go to <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://grdc.com.au/events">https://grdc.com.au/events</a><br /><br />Get the latest from GroundCover: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://grdc.com.au/groundcover">https://grdc.com.au/groundcover</a><br /><br />PODCAST: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/podcast/grdc-podcast/id1435125424?mt=2">https://itunes.apple.com/au/podcast/grdc-podcast/id1435125424?mt=2</a><br />FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/theGRDC">https://www.facebook.com/theGRDC</a><br />TWITTER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/theGRDC">https://twitter.com/theGRDC</a><br />INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/thegrdc/">https://www.instagram.com/thegrdc/</a>{% endraw %}
