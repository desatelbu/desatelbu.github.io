{% raw %}► Historical Then And Now Photos, Locations and Cities<br />► Hello everyone and welcome back to Mystery Scoop.<br />In this unique video presentation, we compare historical Then and Now photos of the same locations, to observe how much the world has changed or perhaps remained the same. In some cases, the changes are enormous and almost unbelievable. The buildings, transportation, and clothing of the people appear to be vastly different. In other cases, landscapes have remained practically unchanged while people and technology have seen significant changes. Let's have a look at a few carefully selected scenes for this video. Let us know in the comments section below which change you found most compelling.<br /><br />Please check the video to see comparison photos showing how the world has changed thanks to rephotography and juxtaposed images.<br /><br />Featured in this video:<br />00:00 Locations Then And Now, Intro<br />00:45 Rysstad, Norway, 1888 vs 2013<br />01:13 Seljestadjuvet, Odda, Norway, 1887 vs 2004<br />01:41 Martin Luther Statue, Dresden, Germany, 1958 vs 2014<br />02:09 Hofbrauhaus Munchen, Germany, 1910 vs 2017<br />02:37 Quai Des Nations, Paris, France, 1900 vs 2017<br />03:05 Poznan, Poland, 1945 vs 2017<br />03:33 Pripyat, Ukraine, 1986 vs 2016<br />04:01 Chaney Glacier, USA, 1911 vs 2005<br />04:29 Moulin Rouge, Paris, France, 1900 vs 2016<br />04:57 Mont Saint-Michel, France, 1908 vs 2016<br />05:25 Reichstag, Germany, 1945 vs 2012<br />05:53 Hammerfest, Norway, 1889 vs 2004<br />06:21 Frauenkirche Dresden, Germany, 1897 vs 2010<br />06:49 Eiffel Tower, Paris, France, 1910 vs 2016<br />07:17 Marcin Street, Poznan, Poland, 1945 vs 2017<br /><br />Watch more Then and Now photos:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuCx3d-8mGB0YkhscgfHl28lDat83qQC-">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuCx3d-8mGB0YkhscgfHl28lDat83qQC-</a><br /><br />Image source:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OldPhotosInRealLife/">https://www.reddit.com/r/OldPhotosInRealLife/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.re.photos/en/">https://www.re.photos/en/</a><br />Licence: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</a><br />---------<br />If you have enjoyed the video, please show some love by LIKING, COMMENTING and SUBSCRIBING to my channel!<br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br />#MysteryScoop  #ThenNow #BeforeAfter #Locations #Time #Changes #RePhotography #OldNew #Cities #Juxtaposed<br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br />For any Copyright issues, please reach out to us first before filing a claim with YouTube.
