{% raw %}Cold as the winter, cold as the night<br />She travel so far there's no way to hide, that she can only glide...<br /><br /><br /><br />From 'Cocooned', Flo's first album, 'Glide' make part from an incredibly personal collection of songs, many of which she wrote in her teenage years. It was then that she started to explore where her family came from and she ended up travelling around the world for two years, visiting family she had never met before, collecting pieces of her identity. From her first love to the understanding that life doesn't always go in a straight line. Flo's lyrics articulate something for her listeners that they’ve perhaps experienced themselves. An incredibly nostalgic album, reflecting the topic of 'change'. With this beautiful voice and talent, Flo takes us on her journey into adulthood.<br />But she already has a new album call “Characters&quot; full of new stories and her new explorations. <br />↪️<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://linktr.ee/floperlin">https://linktr.ee/floperlin</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Lyrics:<br />She put her hands on the ground<br />Then she dug herself in so she couldn't be found<br />She said my mother's got eyes just like mine<br />So I put up a smile in the night for sometime<br /><br />Love me, that's all<br />Cause I don't have the courage to be vunerable<br /><br />Cold as the river, cold as the night<br />She travel so far, there's no way to hide<br />And cold as the winter, cold as the night<br />She travel so far, there's no way to hide<br />She can only glide<br />She can only glide<br /><br />She built a house of stone<br />But when the wind blew it down well her breath was her home<br />It's the courage which carved out her face<br />It's the love whithin grief that moved out of grace<br /><br />Love me, that's all<br />Love me, that is all<br /><br />Cold as the river, cold as the night <br />She travel so far, there's no way to hide<br />And cold as the winter, cold as the night<br />She travel so far, there's no way to hide<br />She can only glide<br />She can only glide<br /><br />She said, love me that's all<br />Love me, that is all<br />That is all<br />That is all<br />That is all<br />That is all<br /><br />Music:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://floperlin.com/">https://floperlin.com/</a><br /><br />Support:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://music.apple.com/us/artist/flo-perlin/1223033309">https://music.apple.com/us/artist/flo-perlin/1223033309</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://floperlin.bandcamp.com/">https://floperlin.bandcamp.com/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/flo-perlin">https://soundcloud.com/flo-perlin</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/2M9I6kX9POMfrxPfePZh05">https://open.spotify.com/artist/2M9I6kX9POMfrxPfePZh05</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/floperlin/">https://www.facebook.com/floperlin/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/flo.perlin/">https://www.instagram.com/flo.perlin/</a>{% endraw %}
