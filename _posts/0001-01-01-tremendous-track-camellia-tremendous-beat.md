{% raw %}This song is so good :D it's like an extended EDM adventure with an epic melody and interesting drops and the BPM changes are so smooth and yeah I just really like this song. Nolanimations is kind of insane for mapping these long songs so quickly and so cleanly, but I sure am glad he's good at it because I was waiting not-so-patiently for a chart of this to come out. Also I bet you won't watch the whole video ;)<br /><br />Punishing stamina challenge: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://beatsaver.com/maps/1e48b">https://beatsaver.com/maps/1e48b</a><br />My ScoreSaber (ranked is for nerds): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://scoresaber.com/u/76561198133627725">https://scoresaber.com/u/76561198133627725</a>{% endraw %}
