{% raw %}What’s up everyone! Do you ever wonder why you aren’t getting further in your business? Do you feel stuck? I want to talk to you today about how to set up your business from the start and as you continue to grow so that you don’t have friction and you can continue to be profitable. I was talking with one of our clients the other day and I realized something was off with how their company was structured. I suddenly had an EPIPHANY moment and knew exactly what needed to happen to bring them more success. <br />Today I'm going to talk about what to look for in a business partner in order to keep growing...and I'm also going to explain the concept known as the 3 legged stool business model. I hope that this video helps you and your business get to the next level!<br /><br />Comment below which leg of the stool you need help assembling. <br /><br /><br />Check out <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://acquisition.com/">https://acquisition.com/</a> for free training and business building resources. <br /><br />Watch more:<br /><br />Opportunity Cost - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/6y7aAiJInKw">https://youtu.be/6y7aAiJInKw</a><br /><br />How I Cured Procrastination - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/EeushgH5jZY">https://youtu.be/EeushgH5jZY</a><br /><br />Why Your Business is NOT Growing - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/OrKw2LTB1HA">https://youtu.be/OrKw2LTB1HA</a><br /><br />About Leila:<br /><br />Leila Hormozi is an American entrepreneur, investor, and philanthropist.
