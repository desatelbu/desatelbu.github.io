It is scheduled to be released worldwide on November 5, 2021, for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X and S. It serves as the eighteenth installment in the overall Call of Duty series. Despite having similar settings, the game doesn't serve as a sequel to Call of Duty: WWII as it establishes new characters and a storyline featuring the birth of the special forces to face an emerging threat at the end of the war during various theaters of World War II across the globe.<br /><br />Vanguard will feature similar gameplay mechanics previously introduced in Modern Warfare thus the player being able to mount wielded weapons to flat surfaces, interact with doors and execute takedowns. New gameplay features allow the player the ability to use a more advanced strategical approach in combat such as blind firing from behind cover, breaking through destructible environmental elements or creating new paths to complete objectives by climbing walls.<br /><br />Vanguard's multiplayer mode is slated to launch with 20 total maps, 16 of which are featured for core game modes, while the other 4 are for a brand new game mode titled &quot;Champion Hill&quot;, stated to be the next iteration of Gunfight, a 2v2 arena mode previously featured in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War. In addition to the Gunsmith system returning in a more advanced form, Vanguard multiplayer will also feature a so-called &quot;Caliber system&quot; which brings immersive elements of destructible and reactive environment to its maps. Besides introducing an upgraded anti-cheat system and a new map scheduled to be launched at a later date, as with Cold War, Vanguard will integrate with Call of Duty: Warzone, allowing players to progress and use weapons, operators and other cosmetics items across both titles, in addition to the existing Modern Warfare and Cold War items in Warzone. Furthermore, just like the previous main installments of the Call of Duty franchise since 2019, Vanguard's multiplayer will also be fully cross-platform play compatible with a support for cross-generation gaming regarding eighth and ninth generation home video game consoles.{% endraw %}
