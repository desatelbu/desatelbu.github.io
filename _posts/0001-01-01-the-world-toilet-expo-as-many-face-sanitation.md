Wide shot of exhibition in Bangkok<br /><br />STORYLINE<br /><br />We all do it but no one will thank you for talking about it.<br /><br />Using the toilet, it seems, is a subject best kept behind closed doors. <br /><br />But in Bangkok on Thursday, the World Toilet Expo and Forum aimed to change all that. <br /><br />The event's goal was to promote interest in and debate about sanitation as a way of drastically improving people's health and lives. <br /><br />According to UNICEF (United Nations Childrens' Fund), more than one (b) billion people lack safe water, and one in three lacks even a basic toilet. <br /><br />The two-day event, created by the World Toilet Organisation, or WTO, showcases the latest trends, technologies and innovations. <br /><br />Among them is a Japanese designed toilet called &quot;The Tornado&quot; which is remotely-controlled using a hand-held unit. <br /><br />The user can raise and lower the lid and seat, and activate water jets that squirt from different angles. <br /><br />&quot;It's not designed for lazy people! The idea is to create a toilet that is convenient and that helps the user relax,&quot; said Dr Yuichi Narukiyo, of the Toto company, which invented it.<br /><br />That's a theme the WTO welcomes, breaking down the taboo over this most basic human function and showing how decent sanitary facilities raise the general standard of living. <br /><br />&quot;Good sanitation and toilets mean people will be healthy and happy and that is the theme of this event,&quot; said Jack Sim, founder of World Toilet Organisation.<br /><br />The Expo's slogan is &quot;Happy Toilet Healthy Life&quot; and several exhibits show how to turn the toilet into a pleasant place to spend these most private of moments. <br /><br />Thailand's own record in this field is seen as being very good, a large number of public toilets are clean, efficient and almost entirely lacking in graffiti or vandalism.<br /><br /><br /><br />Find out more about AP Archive: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork">http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork</a> <br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/AP_Archive">https://twitter.com/AP_Archive</a> <br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/APArchives">https://www.facebook.com/APArchives</a> ​​<br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/APNews/">https://www.instagram.com/APNews/</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />You can license this story through AP Archive: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/e4892c7a69deb4ca02924debeb1841ba">http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/e4892c7a69deb4ca02924debeb1841ba</a>{% endraw %}
