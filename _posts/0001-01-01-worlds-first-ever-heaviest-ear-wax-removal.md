Heaviest Ear Wax Removal (World Record - Ear Wax 'Sausage' Removed)<br /><br />ONSCREEN CREDIT - Mr Neel Raithatha (Consultant Audiologist) - The Hear Clinic &amp; Clearwax<br /><br />This audiologist couldn’t believe how much earwax he removed from one patient’s ears. Neel Raithatha is a consultant audiologist at The Hear Clinic in Oadby, Leicestershire, UK, who has removed many strange objects from patients’ ears, however none quite as shocking as this one. On September 14, 2021, a man came into the clinic after several weeks of suffering from hearing loss, ear pain and vertigo. Neel examined the man’s ear and found lots of deeply compacted earwax build-up. It took 20 minutes to remove all of the built-up earwax and it weighed 1.4 grams - a new record for Neel.<br /><br />ear, wax, heavy, removal, Neel Raithatha, The Hear Clinic, <br /><br />**Please contact licensing@catersnews.com for media / licensing / broadcast usage**<br /><br />SUBMIT A VIDEO: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.catersnews.com/submit-content/">https://www.catersnews.com/submit-content/</a><br /><br />Check out more videos like this one:<br /><br />World's Funniest Flight Attendant (Hilarious Viral Video) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfaYKYFYHBk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfaYKYFYHBk</a><br /><br />Teenager Can 'Delay' Her Voice (Funny Viral Video) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5TaxX6RHZ4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5TaxX6RHZ4</a><br /><br />Man Dressed As T-Rex Plays With 500LB Alligator <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrnFuhrczyw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrnFuhrczyw</a><br /><br />Connect with Caters:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/CatersNews/">https://www.facebook.com/CatersNews/</a><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://catersmediagroup.com/">https://catersmediagroup.com/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/caters_news/">https://www.instagram.com/caters_news/</a><br /><br />Company Information:<br /><br />Caters Clips is owned and operated by Caters News Agency Ltd, an international multimedia content provider.
