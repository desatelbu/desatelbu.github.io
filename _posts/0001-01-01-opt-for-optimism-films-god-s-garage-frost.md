{% raw %}PC Williams and his crew of volunteers at God’s Garage are changing the lives of single moms, widows and wives of deployed military members by repairing and gifting vehicles for them, free of charge. The idea was born out of a desire to turn simple acts of kindness into lasting positivity in the world. They’ve found that a little bit of generosity can change someone’s life, one vehicle at a time.<br /><br />Visit www.opt4optimism.com find out more about God’s Garage and how you can #OptForOptimism too, and view all of the Opt For Optimism Films here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2NuKTwe">https://bit.ly/2NuKTwe</a>{% endraw %}
