{% raw %}My money song makes counting money and identifying coins easy. <br /><br />In my money song video, I show each of the coins from the front and back. The video also teaches the value of the coin through simple coin combinations equaling the value of another coin. <br /><br />My money song, &quot;Show Me the Money&quot; is on my album, &quot;Math in Motion&quot;. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.jackhartmann.com/album/counting-songs-math-in-motion/">https://www.jackhartmann.com/album/counting-songs-math-in-motion/</a><br /><br />Lyrics<br />Five pennies make a nickel<br />Two nickels make a dime<br />Two dimes and a nickel make a quarter every time<br />Hold them in your hand as quick as a bunny<br />When I say the coin you show me the money<br /><br />A penny, a penny as quick as a bunny<br />Show me, show me, show me the money<br /><br />A nickel, a nickel as quick as a bunny<br />Show me, show me, show me the money<br /><br />A dime, a dime as quick as a bunny<br />Show me, show me, show me the money<br /><br />A quarter, a quarter as quick as a bunny<br />Show me, show me, show me the money<br /><br />Five pennies make a nickel<br />Two nickels make a dime<br />Two dimes and a nickel make a quarter every time<br />Show me the money!!{% endraw %}
