It seems most people would rather talk about a problem than offer a solution. They would rather complain than praise. The media thrives on controversy and tragedy.

In this new series, Andrew addresses the subject head-on. You’ll learn how to rise above the noise of negativity and live your life according to the promises of God’s Word. It’s an uphill climb, but the view and the fresh air at the top are well worth the effort.   <br />  <br />Being positive affects the state of your heart and life, and as a result, directly impacts the world around you.
