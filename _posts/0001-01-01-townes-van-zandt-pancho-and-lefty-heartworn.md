{% raw %}Townes Van Zandt playing a medley of his hit.  This is &quot;Pancho &amp; Lefty&quot; played at Uncle Seymour's place.  Taken from the DVD extras on &quot;Heartworn Highways&quot;.  If you have any interest in this type of music you MUST BUY THIS DVD.  It is outstanding in every possible way.  It'll show you real country music the way it was . . . and should be.  Not this overproduced, &quot;all hat, no cattle&quot;, pop-music crap that Nashville suits have always force fed the public.<br /><br />For more from this album and more tune in to TheRecordSelector.com  Every selection comes from a record in my collection!{% endraw %}
