{% raw %}There are approximately 20,000 genes in the human genome. A mutation, or permanent variation, in just one gene can lead to a genetic condition. Knowing what causes a genetic condition is the first step in understanding how, potentially through ongoing research in gene therapy, healthcare providers might be able to treat these conditions differently.<br />--<br /><br />BioMarin is a global biotechnology company focused on developing first-in-class and best-in-class therapeutics that provide meaningful advances to patients who live with serious and life-threatening rare genetic diseases.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.BioMarin.com">http://www.BioMarin.com</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.Hemdifferently.com">http://www.Hemdifferently.com</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.Facebook.com/BioMarinOfficial">http://www.Facebook.com/BioMarinOfficial</a>   <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.Linkedin.com/company/biomarin/">http://www.Linkedin.com/company/biomarin/</a>  <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/biomarinofficial/">https://www.instagram.com/biomarinofficial/</a>{% endraw %}
