{% raw %}Today’s consumers live multi dimensional, multi platform lives and their buying behaviors reflect the same complex dynamics. These days it’s rare for a customer to be a ‘purely online’ or ‘purely physical&quot; consumer; increasingly they expect their service provider of choice to deliver convenience, choice and seamless interaction across all channels. All of this puts increasing pressure on companies and organizations to deliver a consistent and seamless customer experience – and by implication, brand experience – whatever the channel.{% endraw %}
