{% raw %}#instacart #gigapps #Instacartshoppers <br /><br />Gig workers are NOT their own bosses and Instacart is NOT our client! No one should rely on Instacart or any other gig app for their main revenue stream. Instacart is volatile and unpredictable and can't be trusted. Please don't rely on other YouTubers who bloviate and gas light you into thinking that you can make the same income they do, in YOUR market. Additionally, PLEASE don't invest in a course or hidden tips and tricks that promise to unveil secrets into you making money on Instacart. IT WON'T WORK! Don't waste your money! <br /><br />My email- jenonthego2@gmail.com<br />Instagram- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/jenonthego2/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/jenonthego2/?hl=en</a><br /><br />I love and respect you all.{% endraw %}
