Join us as we head to Magen's Bay for some snorkeling excitement, miss seeing Drake's Seat, and miss going up the skyride to Paradise Point... then it's time for an evening of onboard entertainment including coloring, comedy, darts, and more!! :P<br /><br />00:00 BOOM!<br />00:04 Welcome To St. Thomas<br />04:24 Magen's Bay<br />08:19 Snorkel Mode<br />14:19 Paradise Point Lost<br />16:09 Let's Do Lunch<br />18:20 Excursion Update<br />21:09 Arts &amp; Crafts<br />23:08 Manhattan Room Dinner<br />25:38 Evening Entertainment<br /><br />It's time for our very first experience with Norwegian Cruise Line!
