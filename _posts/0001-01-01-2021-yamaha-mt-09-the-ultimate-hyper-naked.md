{% raw %}Yamaha MT-09<br /><br />Revolutionising an icon<br />Its large-capacity 889cc EU5-compliant CP3 engine pushes out higher levels of torque at lower rpm, giving you even more explosive acceleration and stronger road-focused performance. A high-tech 6-axis IMU governs the best-in-class electronic rider aids, to give you ultimate control. Moreover, the QSS enables you to change gear very quickly, while making downshifts more stable.<br /><br />For razor sharp handling, the new model features a compact aluminium chassis, along with adjustable suspension and super-light wheels. Dual 298mm front brakes with a radial master cylinder ensure fingertip control. Plus, the radical next-generation styling and pure, coverless chassis design confirm the MT-09's status as the ultimate Hyper Naked.<br /><br />All about anything please contact via toprated.technology@gmail.com<br /><br />#yamahamt09<br />#mt09<br />#yamaha{% endraw %}
