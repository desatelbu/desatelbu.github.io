{% raw %}Most folks think that bear defense revolves around one age-old debate: pistol versus bear spray. MeatEater's Clay Newcomb, a long time bear man, has always wanted to go deeper and figure out what he can do better in the bear woods. So, Clay sets off to interview Todd Orr, who was mauled twice by a sow grizzly, and then hits the pistol range to be trained by a professional handgun instructor. He also seeks advice about bear safety from a Montana Fish and Wildlife bear technician who's handled hundreds of bear conflicts and, lastly, puts his bear spray to the test in a mock bear-charge simulation. Will Clay come away for the answers he's looking for?<br />#tauruspartner <br /><br />Presented by @taurusfirearms<br /><br />Check out the Bear Grease podcast for more from Clay every Wednesday: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3mwV1GT">https://bit.ly/3mwV1GT</a> <br /><br />#meateater #fueledbynature<br /><br />----------------<br /><br />Watch full MeatEater episodes here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://episodes.themeateater.com">http://episodes.themeateater.com</a>  <br /><br />Shop our Merch Store: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://themeateaterstore.com">http://themeateaterstore.com</a>  <br /><br />Follow us:<br />Web: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.themeateater.com">http://www.themeateater.com</a> <br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/meateater">http://instagram.com/meateater</a> <br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/StevenRinellaMeatEater">https://www.facebook.com/StevenRinellaMeatEater</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/meateatertv">https://twitter.com/meateatertv</a>{% endraw %}
