{% raw %}The new Miss America was crowned last night with Miss Alaska, 20-year-old Emma Broyles, winning the title. But after years of plummeting ratings, this year’s 100th anniversary show didn’t even air on broadcast TV. Instead, viewers streamed it on NBC’s Peacock, and the reviews were pretty bad. “Cringey,” and “a mess,” posted disappointed fans. Many credit the competition’s downfall to ditching the swimsuit competition in 2018, and turning it into a scholarship contest rather than a beauty pageant.{% endraw %}
