{% raw %}The Labour Party like everyone else will be watching the results in Germany very closely. <br /><br />(Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/C4_News_Subscribe)">https://bit.ly/C4_News_Subscribe)</a> <br /><br />If the SPD and Olaf Scholz prevail it would be a major boost for the centre left across Europe.<br /><br />If the Christian Democrats of Angela Merkel don't do so well it's because of the infighting in a party that Angela Merkel had moved to the left especially on the defining issues of refugees.<br /><br />And whatever the numbers today, the final outcome will depend on coalition horse trading. <br /><br /> -----------------------  <br /><br />Follow us on Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/Channel4News">https://www.instagram.com/Channel4News</a>{% endraw %}
