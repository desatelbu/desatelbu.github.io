They occur when the protective layer of mucus in our stomach gets damaged. This can be caused due to the following reasons.<br /><br />First is a type of bacteria called Helicobacter pylori. Through contaminated food or water, when these bacteria enter our stomach, they start to breakdown the mucus. As a result, the stomach acid which digests our food, begins to irritate and damage the lining of our stomach, thus causing a stomach ulcer.<br /><br />Second is long-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin and ibuprofen. These drugs gradually reduce and slow down the production of mucus, thus allowing the stomach acid to create an ulcer.<br /><br />Lastly, in very rare cases, it is also believed that excess production of stomach acid is the culprit behind stomach ulcers.{% endraw %}
