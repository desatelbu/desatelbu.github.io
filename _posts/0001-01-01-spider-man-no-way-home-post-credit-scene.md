{% raw %}Letâ€™s talk post-credit scenes specifically and their larger implications across the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Spider-Man: No Way Home is so full of big, huge, spoilerly surprises, somehow, its two credit scenes may not even register. Part of that is because almost every single Marvel movie to this point has had at least one scene, so everyone knows to sit in the theater until the very end to see some kind of a surprise. #SpiderManNoWayHome #NoWayHomePostCredit #PJExplained<br /><br />My Social Media Handel's: <br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/pjexplained/">https://www.instagram.com/pjexplained/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/pjexplained/">https://twitter.com/pjexplained/</a> <br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/pjexplained/">https://www.facebook.com/pjexplained/</a><br />#thePJ<br /><br />Surprise!: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/_QyhmwZ2TIk">https://youtu.be/_QyhmwZ2TIk</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/HUYb9An6oPI">https://youtu.be/HUYb9An6oPI</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/ddYJ57-OgxA">https://youtu.be/ddYJ57-OgxA</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/2r5C5_UAbL4">https://youtu.be/2r5C5_UAbL4</a><br /><br />The PJ Explained is a web channel intended to promote cinema through films review, interviews, discussions, video essays and analytical compilations.
