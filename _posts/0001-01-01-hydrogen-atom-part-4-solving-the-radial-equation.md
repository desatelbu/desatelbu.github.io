{% raw %}In this video I will finish solving the hydrogen atom by solving the radial equation that we found in part 1.<br /><br />In the next video we will write some of the wavefunctions<br /><br />My name is Nick Heumann, I am a recently graduated physicist. I love to teach physics, so I decided to give YouTube a try. English is not my first language, but I hope that you can understand me well enough regardless.<br />▬ Contents of this video  ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬<br />00:00:00 How to begin<br />00:01:30 Explaining the first change of variable<br />00:08:00 Rearranging the equation<br />00:09:50 Substituting in the potential <br />00:12:00 cleaning up the notation<br />00:15:10 Looking for another change of variable<br />00:17:30 Defining rho_0<br />00:18:40 Determining the solution when rho is large<br />00:21:10 Determining the solution when rho is small<br />00:27:20 Looking for the rest of the solution (v)<br />00:28:00 Differentiating twice<br />00:33:50 Substituting back into the differential equation<br />00:37:50 Solving the resulting equation via power series<br />00:42:32 Changing the indexes<br />00:44:41 Deriving the recursion relation<br />00:49:30 Discovering the quantum number &quot;n&quot;<br />00:51:14 Determining the allowed energies<br />00:55:35 Identifying allowed values for &quot;n&quot;, l and m<br />00:59:50 Writing down the actual solution to the radial equation{% endraw %}
