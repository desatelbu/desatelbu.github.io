{% raw %}Based on the 1865 short story by Mark Twain, this is our entry to the ToY (Tales of Yore) Brickfilming competition hosted by BricksInMotion.com.  This story was Twain's first great success as a writer and brought him national attention.  Hopefully it will do the same for us. ;)<br /><br /><br /><br />EDIT: We ended up placing third in the competition!{% endraw %}
