{% raw %}Changing the packaging of Pilsner Urquell may not seem as significant at first glance, but it proves that even a small detail can have a huge impact. To explain the real impact on the environment, we compared the weight of the saved waste to the weight of the heaviest animal living in our nature. With simple symbolism, we told a story that reassured people Pilsner Urquell takes sustainability seriously. We even let them &quot;touch&quot; the stags in AR, thus deepening their relationship with the brand.{% endraw %}
