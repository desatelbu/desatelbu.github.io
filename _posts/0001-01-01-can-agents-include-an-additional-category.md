{% raw %}Can agents include an additional category of licence to their property licence in NSW? Yes they can.  If an agent holds either a Class 1 or a Class 2 Real Estate Licence or a Stock &amp; Station Agents Licence, they can now complete the required training to gain the additional Units of Competency and upgrade to include the other category of licence.  This is a new change to the Property and Stock Agents (Qualifications) Order and has created a more streamlined approach to licensing and for agents to include additional service areas to their business.<br /><br />Rosy Sullivan | College Principal &amp; Director<br />Australian College of Professionals - RTO 91513.<br />Subscribe to our channel for future content.<br />Please visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.acop.edu.au​​​​">https://www.acop.edu.au​​​​</a> for more information on our courses.<br />Like us on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/AustCOP/​​​​">https://www.facebook.com/AustCOP/​​​​</a><br />Follow us on LinkedIn: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/school/austr...​">https://www.linkedin.com/school/austr...​</a><br />Follow us on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/College_Aus​​​​">https://twitter.com/College_Aus​​​​</a><br />Follow us on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/austcop/​​​">https://www.instagram.com/austcop/​​​</a>{% endraw %}
