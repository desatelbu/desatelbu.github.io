{% raw %}The return of the series where I list 5 Fragrances from 5 different categories:<br />1. A STRAIGHT UP CLONE: This will be a Fragrance that is attempting to smell nearly exactly like the Fragrance in question.<br />2. ALTERNATIVE WITH A TWIST: A Fragrance that has a similar vibe but has a unique twist or difference.<br />3. NOTE SIBILNG: a fragrance that has the same primary or prominent note.<br />4. FURTHER ADVENTURE: A fragrance that could be seen as the potential 'next step' in your Fragrance journey on from the Fragrance in question<br />5. WILDCARD: a Fragrance you may or may not like if you enjoy the Fragrance talked about, this selection is something to take not of if you want to be more adventurous. <br /><br />Today I try not to get killed by recommending you Aventus alternatives.{% endraw %}
