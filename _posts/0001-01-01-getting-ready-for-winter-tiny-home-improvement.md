{% raw %}I'm finally back in the van and getting things fixed up for the winter. It's weird being back, but it also feels good to be back on the road. <br /><br />A trans temperature gauge seemed like a good investment considering that I am now on my 3rd transmission after traveling for only 5 months.<br /><br />I'm still not sure if I have resolved my charging issues. I can no longer rely on solar to supply 100% of my power and the AGM battery seems to charge very slowly. <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://patreon.com/maxoutfun">https://patreon.com/maxoutfun</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/maxoutfun/">https://instagram.com/maxoutfun/</a><br />themaxoutfun@gmail.com{% endraw %}
