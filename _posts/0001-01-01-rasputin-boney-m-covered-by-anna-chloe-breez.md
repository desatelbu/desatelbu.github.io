{% raw %}Hello everyone! This week I sang Rasputin by Boney M. with my pal @Chloe Breez!<br /><br />This entire video is the result of sleep deprivation. Can you tell?<br /><br />Huge thank you to Chloe for being a pal and cranking these lines out in 3 days. What a peach she is. <br /><br />With this, we come to the end of another year of content! I’ll be taking the next 5 weeks off and will return on the 29th of January. I hope you all enjoyed the covers I’ve put out this past year and want to thank you for the ongoing support. It really does mean the world to me.<br /><br />I’m off to kick back and relax for the next month. I hope you all have an easy and peaceful holiday season and I’ll see you all in the new year! I’ll see you on January 29th.<br />♥<br />(you can listen to this bad boy on the go too: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/annapantsu/i-see-the-light-feat-peter-hollens)">https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/annapantsu/i-see-the-light-feat-peter-hollens)</a><br />___________________________________________________________<br />• Credits • “Rasputin” - Hamilton <br />Artwork: Eryn Williams| [<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.erynwilliams.com/]">https://www.erynwilliams.com/]</a> <br />Instrumental: produced by HaiDL | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://haidl.live/">https://haidl.live/</a> <br />Vocals: Chloe | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/ChloeBreez">https://twitter.com/ChloeBreez</a> + <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdmGxTFN3ASyvIJy8wn-mzQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdmGxTFN3ASyvIJy8wn-mzQ</a> <br />Anna (that’s me) <br />(thank you to everyone who helped make this cover possible!
