{% raw %}The hazard of Talvivaara's gypsum waste pond leakage has been fearfully expected all the time. As it happened on Sunday 4-Nov-2012, a week ago, we are now in a situation where the whole mass of waste water is expected to drain empty - but to where?<br />It has been publicly announced that the masses of waste water will be guided into the four back-up ponds. Construction work for the fourth back-up bond is expected to be ready on Sunday 11-Nov-2012.<br /><br />This last safety barrier is something they have not wanted to show to the media.<br />Filming tours on the scene have been arranged around the gypsum waste pond.<br />Nobody has been allowed to film this &quot;back-up pond&quot; to be constructed on a marshland as an attempt to stop the masses of waste there.<br />Concealing the hard facts during the ongoing situation has given the media and authorities an overly optimistic image of the safety measures. The &quot;Back-up pond&quot; is a mere marshland pond enclosured by dams - from where the toxic substances will <br />travel to downstread and ground waters. All the huge masses of soil and ground will turn into a toxic waste at the watershed area - by the source of Savolax and Kainuu waters.{% endraw %}
