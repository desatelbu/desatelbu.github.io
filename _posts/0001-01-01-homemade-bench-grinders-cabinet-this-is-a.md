{% raw %}This is a video about the arrangement of the workplace for multifunctional Bench Grinders.<br />This time I decided to spend some time arranging my workspace in my garage. I have long planned to do something more functional with the steel cabinet on which stands my old Bench Grinder, and replace it alltogether with something more practical.<br />It's been about 1.5 months since the premiere of my last video. During this time, my family and I contracted covid-19 and as a result I could not keep up my hobby during this time. However, it's all behind now and I am excited to share with you,  my newly invented and made at home product.<br />Stay safe and thank you all for watching!{% endraw %}
