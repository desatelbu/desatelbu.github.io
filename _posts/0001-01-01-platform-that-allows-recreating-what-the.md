{% raw %}FEEL FREE TO POST ON YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA -  Kinematic Artifact Detection is the ONLY platform that allows us to recreate what the voting machines did but relies only on the ballot paper NOT what the machine says it did with your vote.  This is WHY the paper ballot is so very important. WE HAVE NEVER talked about this one aspect of our technology but when you watch it you will GET IT and see just how powerful KAD is and WHY all 50 states need to be audited! #KinematicArtifacts{% endraw %}
