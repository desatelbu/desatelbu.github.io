More than 95% of the world’s electrical power is generated from turbines. Turbines act as prime movers and cause rotors within generators to rotate.<br /><br />Once electrical power has been generated, it is distributed through a series of conductors (think of copper or aluminium cables) to an electrical transformer. <br /><br />Electrical transformers increase voltage and consequently reduce the current (Ohms law), but the power remains roughly the same. It is necessary to increase the voltage to reduce power losses (P=I^2R), but it also allows for the use of smaller conductors to be used. Transformers that increase voltage are referred to as ‘step-up’ transformers. <br /><br />Conductors then feed from the transformer to a series of transmission towers (electrical pylons). Power reaches the area where it will be consumed and is reduced in voltage by a step-down transformer (voltage reducing transformer). <br /><br />The equipment necessary to increase and reduce voltage (transformers, breakers, surge arresters etc.) are housed within structures known as ‘substations’ (normally open air switchyards).<br /><br />It may be necessary to reduce the voltage several times until it reaches a level that is suitable for consumers (10 kV, 6 kV, 3 kV, 380 V etc.). The voltage required by consumers depends upon how the electrical power is utilised. Industrial plants require 3 phase medium voltage power whilst residential areas require single phase (1 phase) 220 V or 110 V. The power grid is split into generation, transmission and distribution sections.<br /><br />********** <br />#saVRee_Nuggets, #saVRee{% endraw %}
