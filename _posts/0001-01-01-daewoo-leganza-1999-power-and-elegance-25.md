{% raw %}Introduced in 1997 the Daewoo Leganza was a truly international project of the South Korean Manufacturer: Bodywork design from Italy, inspired by a rejected Jaguar Project, engines designed in Australia and manufacture plants in Korea, Egypt, Ukraine, Poland, Romania and Vietnam.<br /><br />Leganza was attracting with it’s reach equipment being more expensive than Renault Megan or Peugeot 406 and in a comparable price to Toyota Avensis.<br /><br />Eleganza and Forza – in Italian elegance and power were the words that inspired the name of his car. Is that only a slogan or are those 2 best words describing this car?<br /><br /><br /><br />Pozdrawiam p. Marka! <br /><br />-------------<br />Music: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.davidcuttermusic.com">https://www.davidcuttermusic.com</a> / @dcuttermusic{% endraw %}
