{% raw %}Most people assume that the government prints money, and that is how money is created. That is not entirely true. Watch this video to find out the role that banks play in the creation of the money supply. AP(R) Macroeconomics on Khan Academy: Macroeconomics is all about how an entire nation√ïs performance is determined and improved over time. Learn how factors like unemployment, inflation, interest rates, economic growth and recession are caused and how they affect individuals and society as a whole. We hit the traditional topics from an AP Macroeconomics course, including basic economic concepts, economic indicators, and the business cycle, national income and price determination, the financial sector, the long-run consequences of stabilization policies, and international trade and finance.
