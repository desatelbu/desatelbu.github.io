{% raw %}I've got  a super easy to sew pattern that is beginner friendly for knit fabrics.  The Tessa Sheath dress from Love Notions fits the bill and I've made 2: one for my Sister in law and one for myself. A few seams and done :)<br /><br />Come and join me for fitting and sewing!<br /><br />The Tessa Sheath dress has been re-released to improve sizing to 5X and add the full bust option.  The price is 60% off ($5) today Friday the 10th ONLY.  Saturday an Sunday, the pattern will be 25% off ($9).  Remember to use my code KARINA10 for an extra 10% off, on top of the discounted prices.  <br /><br />Here is my affiliate link:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.lovenotions.com/product/tessa?affiliates=366">https://www.lovenotions.com/product/tessa?affiliates=366</a><br /><br />See a playlist of my other Tessa Sheath dresses on my channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwk5xT21q_c0xQGzEVZGZW6VfLwe6Dm_u">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwk5xT21q_c0xQGzEVZGZW6VfLwe6Dm_u</a><br /><br />Visit my blog post with all my 5 versions and videos all in one place: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://liftingpinsandneedles.com/2020/03/20/tessa-sheath-dress-love-notions-polka-dots-a-mash-and-color-blocking/">https://liftingpinsandneedles.com/2020/03/20/tessa-sheath-dress-love-notions-polka-dots-a-mash-and-color-blocking/</a><br /><br />See a playlist of my ever-growing Love Notions makes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwk5xT21q_c0yd3TyWiMkAOe65oXJp-oB">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwk5xT21q_c0yd3TyWiMkAOe65oXJp-oB</a><br /><br />Specifics:<br />* Mine is size XL, standard bust<br />*Added 1&quot; length to bodice area above the bust apex (front and back)<br />*Swayback adjustment 5/8&quot;<br />*Longer hem length<br />*Sister in law's is size Small, standard bust in Liverpool knit<br /><br />The Tessa can be mashed with the 7 styles in the Sybil Illusion Skirt Collection.
