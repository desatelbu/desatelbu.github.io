{% raw %}Thanks to Bandai Namco for a copy of Tales of Arise! <br /><br />A world of nature drawn with the “Atmospheric Shader”:<br />We are introducing a new graphics shader, inspired by anime and watercolor painting. Characters with attractive designs travel among backgrounds filled with beautiful and delicate visuals.<br /><br />Explore a world that feels alive:<br />Explore the world of Dahna, where a mix of unique, natural environments change in appearance based on the time of day. Climb over the rocky terrain, swim in rivers, gather around the campfire, cook food, head to the next town, defeat the master of an alien planet, and liberate the people!<br /><br />Stylish action and battles:<br />Through the new system “Boost Strike”, you can now chain combos of powerful attacks together with your party members. Chain Artes, Boost Attacks, and Boost Strike combos to take down your enemies!<br /><br />Experience the story of the divided Renan and Dahnan people:<br />The protagonists who will determine the fate of these two worlds are Alphen and Shionne. They will overcome hardships and grow together with their unique group of friends. Gorgeous animation by ufotable is inserted at key points in the story, adding more color to our protagonists’ journey.<br /><br />#TalesofArise #FightinCowboy #LetsPlay<br /><br />Tales of Arise Let's Play Series: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7RtZMiaOk8g3ShMsu8rXcVIvZ98Qlrzk">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7RtZMiaOk8g3ShMsu8rXcVIvZ98Qlrzk</a><br /><br />Become a member! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/fightincowboy/join">https://www.youtube.com/fightincowboy/join</a> or<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9N0DmacOi4iWKQyygX89OQ/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9N0DmacOi4iWKQyygX89OQ/join</a><br />Want to leave a tip? <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://streamlabs.com/fightincowboy/tip">https://streamlabs.com/fightincowboy/tip</a><br /><br />Livestreams are every Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday at 5:00 Pacific time!<br /><br />Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/fightincowboy">https://discord.gg/fightincowboy</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/fightincowboy">https://twitter.com/fightincowboy</a><br /><br />All recordings and streams are done using Streamlabs OBS, an Elgato 4K60 Pro, Logitech Pro X Headset, and a Samson G-Track Pro Mic.<br /><br />Whether it's a headset or a keyboard, Logitech has the best gaming peripherals around. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://g.logi.link/fightincowboy">https://g.logi.link/fightincowboy</a><br /><br />Use Amazon a bunch?
