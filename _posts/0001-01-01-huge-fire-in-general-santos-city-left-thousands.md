{% raw %}Hey Fam!<br />I don't ask much, but for this one, I really need your help. Last November 3, 2021, there was a fire incident at Purok Saeg, Calumpang General Santos City (this is only a 30-minute drive from our house). Thousands of people suffer from inconceivable losses due to the recent disaster. We are asking help for these families who have lost everything from the fire. They are in desperate need of food and clothing.<br /><br />For Gensan Area, please message me on our FB page and Instagram same handle - The Eaton Squad for drop off area of your donations, and to those who wish to donate funds, you may do so and all funds collected will be put forward to buy more grocery items and clothes for the fire victims. Any amount will make a difference in each and every family who are affected by this incident. Thank you in advance for your generosity. God Bless us all!<br />Source<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://web.facebook.com/EVCatulpos/videos/42994863878523">https://web.facebook.com/EVCatulpos/videos/42994863878523</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://web.facebook.com/tatakpacquiao/photos/pcb.334167845180865/334155521848764/">https://web.facebook.com/tatakpacquiao/photos/pcb.334167845180865/334155521848764/</a><br />#devastatingfire #helpisneeded #saegcalumpangfire<br />__________________________________________________________________<br />If you plan to travel to the Philippines during the time of the pandemic, <br />you can get the Latest Travel Update here to the Philippines:<br />ðŸ”´ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...</a><br />________________________________________________________________<br />CONTACT INFORMATION:<br />FACEBOOK: Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/theeatonsquad">https://www.facebook.com/theeatonsquad</a><br />INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/theeatonsquad">http://instagram.com/theeatonsquad</a><br />BUSINESS EMAIL: theeatonsquad@gmail.com<br />________________________________________________________________<br />We thank you all so much for all the support to our channel, it means <br />a lot to us.
