During most lung infections, inflammation and mucus build-up occurs in the airways of the lungs which makes it more difficult to breathe. Your body triggers a cough response in order to get rid of the foreign materials in your lungs, allowing you to take in more air and breathe more freely.<br /><br />➡️ Fever<br />A fever can occur for many reasons, but it's most commonly seen when the body is fighting an infection. The average body temperature is 98.6°F (37°C) but it can fluctuate some, usually with warmer temperatures occurring later in the day. In general, some individuals will have a higher baseline temperature than others, but when a lung infection is present, it can increase as high as 105°F (40.5°C).<br /><br />➡️ Weakness and Fatigue <br />Weakness and fatigue are two of the most common signs of a lung infection. That is because, fighting off an infection takes energy from your body that you may have a difficult time manufacturing because the body is ill. Running a fever, battling with an infection, and a general feeling of unease can leave anyone feeling tired and a bit weak.<br /><br />➡️ Shortness of Breath<br />Shortness of breath is a symptom that occurs in most lung infections and can remain after other symptoms have gone away. This is likely due to inflammation that has occurred in the airways of the lungs. Shortness of breath can happen when performing activities that you can normally do pretty easily, such as walking to the mailbox or going up a flight of stairs.<br /> <br />➡️ You Have Suffered Through a Bad Cold<br />Because the symptoms of a cold virus are so similar to the flu virus, some medical professionals initially have a difficult time distinguishing between the two. Regardless, both the flu and common cold can result in the occurrence of a lung infection. Bacterial infections may also occur after a viral infection because of the disruption of bacteria in the lungs.<br /><br />➡️ Hair Loss <br />According to the Academy of Dermatology, the body loses 50-100 strands of hair per day. In the case of a lung infection, this number of strands lost per day will be increased. Telogen effluvium is a condition in which hair loss occurs after a stressful experience, as seen with an illness.<br /><br />➡️ Loss of Taste or Smell<br />It may come to you as a surprise, but a very large percentage of people who have tested positive for a lung infection will experience a loss of taste and/or smell. This is because certain viruses can affect the olfactory cells in the upper nasal cavity which directly affects your ability to smell.<br /><br />💥Lung Infection Signs Without Knowing [Full Guide] ➜ ➜ ➜ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2Th5aJY">https://bit.ly/2Th5aJY</a><br /><br />—————<br /><br />💙MORE FROM RTZ<br />▪ Free TMC Practice Exam 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2XlwASL">http://bit.ly/2XlwASL</a><br />▪ Free RRT Cheat Sheet 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2IbmOKB">http://bit.ly/2IbmOKB</a><br />▪ Resources for RT's 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2WVV5qo">http://bit.ly/2WVV5qo</a><br />▪ Testimonials 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2x7b5Gl">http://bit.ly/2x7b5Gl</a><br /><br />🌐FOLLOW US<br />▪ Instagram 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2FhF0jV">http://bit.ly/2FhF0jV</a><br />▪ Twitter 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2ZsS6T1">http://bit.ly/2ZsS6T1</a><br />▪ Facebook 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2MSEejt">http://bit.ly/2MSEejt</a><br />▪ Pinterest 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2ZwVLPw">http://bit.ly/2ZwVLPw</a><br /><br />🚑MEDICAL DISCLAIMER<br />Medicine and Respiratory Therapy are continuously changing practices.
