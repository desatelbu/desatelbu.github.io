{% raw %}All over Europe and the world, billions are being poured into taking successful practices from one context and adapting them to others. When a working solution has been found, why start from scratch? If these efforts were successful, they would more than pay for themselves, while dramatically improving the running of our cities and increasing our quality of life.<br /><br />Sometimes these efforts to replicate and upscale best practices pay off big time, and sometimes it ends up being... a little more complicated than that. Enjoy this recording of our webinar on 9 April at 10.00 CET to hear from experts who have spent years working on replication and upscaling to discuss the latest insights on what works, what doesn't and why.<br /><br />- Han Vandevyvere (Vito) shares insights from the Smart Cities Information System<br /><br />- Jana Koleva shares insights from the replication work of Burgas in Sharing Cities<br />- Loriana Paolucci (Isinnova) shares insights from TRANS-URBAN-EU-CHINA<br /><br />- Hans-Martin Neumann (Austrian Institute of Technology) also shares insights from TRANS-URBAN-EU-CHINA{% endraw %}
