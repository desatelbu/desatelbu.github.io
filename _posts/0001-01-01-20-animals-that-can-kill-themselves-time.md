{% raw %}Time for a happy, uplifting video to get you through these weird times of lockdowns, crazy governments and pandemics. Oh wait - nope, this is a video about suicidal animals. Well, can you blame them, honestly? Imagine living on a planet with a hyper intelligent and weird looking species that had super weapons and seemed to want nothing more than to destroy you, your home and then maybe eat you. That’s probably how life feels to some of these animals living with us. From the sheep whose horns are a little on the dangerous side to the mystical snake that symbolises eternity and death, here’s 20 Animals That Can Kill Themselves<br /><br />► For copyright matters please contact us: OfficialAmerikano@hotmail.com{% endraw %}
