{% raw %}In the spring of 1997, a man who was considered unorthodox because his physique did not fit the mold of a professional boxer, entered the ring for a title fight. He won that fight by knockout and became the IBA Heavyweight Champion. He went on to have a professional record of 77 wins, with 57knockouts and only 10 losses. He was known as a man with a big heart and incredible tenacity, the king of 4-round fights. His name is Eric Esch, commonly known as Butterbean. <br /><br />#Boxing #Knockout{% endraw %}
