{% raw %}The independent office of Budget Responsibility, funded by the UK Treasury, has established that despite the UK securing a much hyped trade deal at the last minute, Brexit has nevertheless shrunk the UK economy by 4% in the long term.  And according to the governmentâ€™s own figures, UK Brexit trade losses are more than 178 times larger than gains from the much vaunted trade deals secured by Liz cut and paste truss and her successor, climate change sceptic, Anne Marie Trevelyan.  But Brexit may be about to get a whole lot worse. With COP26 out of the way, the UK is now threatening to trigger Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol, which could prompt the European Union to suspend the post-Brexit trade deal altogether, and impose tariffs on all UK goods entering the EU.<br /><br />The channel where we speak truth to power about British politics, and challenge the establishment narrative peddled by the overwhelmingly right wing press and BBC.  In the words of Noam Chomsky, &quot;power knows the truth already, and is busy concealing it&quot;. Let's make it as hard for them as possible to do so, on Brexit, Corruption, the Economy, the NHS, Electoral Reform, Taxation, Equality and Climate Change.<br /><br />Subscribe to the channel to stay up-to-date with new shows every Wednesday and Saturday.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TruthToPower?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/c/TruthToPower?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />Please remember to hit that Like button, and if you'd like to be notified of the latest shows, please hit that notification bell!<br /><br />Follow us on <br />Twitter.com/TruthToPowerTV<br />Facebook.com/PowerKnows<br /><br />#ADifferentBias<br />#MaximilienRobespierre<br />#MichaelLambert{% endraw %}
