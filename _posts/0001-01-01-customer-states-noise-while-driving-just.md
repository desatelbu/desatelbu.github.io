No oil on dipstick either.&quot; As mentioned, the engine will need to be rebuilt and will cost around $9000 USD for parts and labor.<br />1:01 Look's like the truck had a custom lowering job and somebody didn't do it properly.<br />1:09 This is waiting for something bad to happen. I also noticed it was a CAT (Caterpillar) battery.<br />1:19 We don't have state inspections where I live (Canada), but I feel like this would be a big fine if the owner got caught!<br />1:26 Always get the vehicle inspected BEFORE buying it. <br />1:37 Rear control arms rusted off, causing the differential to move freely like you saw in the clip.<br />1:49 This Lexus came in for a noise while driving. Look's like they must have hit a big pot hole.<br />1:55 The rims on this 2014 Dodge Charger were 24's and 9 inch wide. As you can see the wheels are too big for the car which is causing the grinding and rubbing noise. <br />2:12 The customer wanted to drive half way across the country (Canada) in these very bald tires. I live in Canada and this is waiting for something VERY bad to happen lol. Winters here can be very rough. <br />2:23 Booger welds! Would this exhaust pass a state safety inspection?<br />2:31 Broken transfer case, brake lines, evap canister and much more.<br />2:46 No hate on this vehicle, I just wanted to share this since it's not something you see every day.<br />3:05 Outro. Thanks for watching!{% endraw %}
