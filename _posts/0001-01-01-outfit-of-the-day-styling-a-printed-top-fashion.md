{% raw %}Have you ever fallen in love with a fabulous print, only to find that you don’t know what to wear it with? Trinny’s outfit of the day is about figuring out the best way to style those tricky pieces. Trinny pairs this Prada top with leopard print for a pattern-clashing moment, layering a rich burgundy tone between the two prints. When it comes to makeup, Sheer Shimmer in Weasie is the star of the show – our neutral rosy bronze shimmer is like lip gloss, blusher and bronzer all in one glorious little pot. A real multitasker, just like her namesake…<br /><br />Join Trinny Woodall as she talks us through her outfit of the day. Whether it be head-to-toe print, soft pastels, or a monochromatic moment, the What Not To Wear co-author gives us her habitual hit of style advice with considered fashion hauls, accessory tips, and the perfect makeup tutorial to go with. Whether it be a half-tucked shirt, a statement belt, or dress styled back-to-front, expect a statement lip or a smoky eye on the side…<br /><br />Makeup all Trinny London, shop the range here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://trinny.co/ootd-mad-prints-shop-sheer-shimmer">https://trinny.co/ootd-mad-prints-shop-sheer-shimmer</a><br />-<br />Sheer Shimmer in Weasie{% endraw %}
