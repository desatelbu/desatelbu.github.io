{% raw %}Broadcaster Justin Smith says Australia has “never really harnessed the enthusiasm for change” amid renewed debate about whether the nation should become a republic.  <br /><br />It comes after Barbados became a republic on November 30 – with Queen Elizabeth II being replaced by President Sandra Mason. <br /><br />“We’ve been through world wars with the British, we have been in love with the Queen for years and we mostly enjoy the connection with the Royal Family,” Mr Smith said. <br /><br />“But we’ve never really harnessed the enthusiasm for change. There’s never been a revolution and it looks like there is never going to be one.”{% endraw %}
