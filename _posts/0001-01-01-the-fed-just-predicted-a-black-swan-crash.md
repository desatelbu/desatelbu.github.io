What that means to you and I, is that the Fed compiled all their data and all their theories, and condensed it all into an 80 page document that explains the risks to the economy right now, what they are, where they come from and how they might develop. The problem is that there are a lot of problems, and it seems as though, contrary to what some people think, the Fed is absolutely aware of them. In this report, the Fed essentially warns us all about the potential catalysts for a market crash, and why we should be paying attention. Now this report is 80 pages long, and believe me it is not an easy read, but luckily for you, Iâ€™ve combed through it all, to bring you the most important parts, the parts that really matter, and explain just why the Fed might be predicting a market crash. <br /><br />DISCLAIMERS:<br />Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for &quot;fair use&quot; for purposes such as criticism, commenting, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
