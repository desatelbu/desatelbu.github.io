Linehan. Rating the mindfulness (defined by Jon Kabat Zinn as paying attention in a particular way; on purpose in the present moment, and non-judgmentally) of the pleasant event, the letting go of worries, and overall pleasant experience.<br />__________________________________________<br /><br />I’ve been using the concepts in Marsha M. Linehan’s emotion self regulation dbt manual as a way to get rid of anxiety, a way to get rid of depression, and a way to get rid of stress in order to better conversate with women who are strangers about the appreciation of their feet. Here you’ll see the results of my progression.<br /><br />Photography, videography, and approaching women who are strangers to get them to model for me is a great way of treating anxiety without meds, and treating depression with meds.{% endraw %}
