{% raw %}This is a little gratitude song.<br /><br />There's such a lot of things I love about livin'<br />On this earth I call my home<br />Sunrise and sunset, shining stars in the sky<br />Such a lot of places left for me to roam<br /><br />There's such a lot of things I love about livin'<br />In the True North Strong and Free (Canada)<br />It's not my place of birth but one I've grown to love<br />It's now my home, the place I'd rather be<br /><br />There's such a lot of things I love about livin'<br />In this house where I lay my head<br />It's warm and cosy; it's my nest to feather<br />Keep your mansions, I'll take this house instead<br /><br />There's such a lot of things I love about livin'<br />With the man who holds my heart<br />He's my dear companion; he's my heart's desire<br />Nothing on this earth can tear us apart<br /><br />There's such a lot of things I love about livin'!!<br />Jakki Annerino   June 12, 2015{% endraw %}
