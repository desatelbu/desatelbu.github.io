{% raw %}This is Track #2 from the 1976 Jim Cole album, Complete In Him<br /><br />Listen to the whole album here - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPcTOx34g9XTOyxV6nSYuIDgAp2W5yo2g">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPcTOx34g9XTOyxV6nSYuIDgAp2W5yo2g</a><br /><br />This was an independent release from Jim Cole. It has a nice folk/Jesus Music feel to it and the quality is very high and it surprises me that a record label didn't pick it up. That said Jim may not have been interested in a record deal we just don't know. There was two different releases of this album, one with 10 tracks and one with 12. Jim reappeared in the music scene in the 90's with several on label albums that essentially continued where this album left off. As I said this is a folk/Jesus music offering with the usual sound of the time. As was common with albums of the period there is a Rock tune, a country tune, and a blues tune, which is very good. Surprisingly there is no bluegrass tune. The guitar work is excellent and the vocals are strong so if folk is our thing this album is for you.<br /><br />Join us on Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/real80sccm/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/real80sccm/</a><br />Follow us on Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Real80sCCM/">https://twitter.com/Real80sCCM/</a><br />See us on Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/real80sccm">https://www.instagram.com/real80sccm</a><br />Visit our Website - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://real80sccm.com/">http://real80sccm.com/</a>{% endraw %}
