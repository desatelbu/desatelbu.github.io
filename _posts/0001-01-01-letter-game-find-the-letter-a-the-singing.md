He reminds them of the shape of the specific letter, then shows them colourful pictures which hide three of that letter (first the upper case, then the lower case letter). Children have 20 seconds to find the letters. <br /><br />In each picture, we include objects that start with the specific letter.<br /><br />We hope you and your children/students will enjoy our Find the Letter Series of alphabet games!<br /><br />For more fun alphabet games, check out our &quot;Write the letter A&quot; video and download the FREE WORKSHEET from our website:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kt0nlWkUBJw&amp;list=PLt7Se3SAnZY6IDPneV86voCllU3yDUlTO">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kt0nlWkUBJw&amp;list=PLt7Se3SAnZY6IDPneV86voCllU3yDUlTO</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://thesingingwalrus.com/free-stuff/alphabet-writing-practice-sheets/">http://thesingingwalrus.com/free-stuff/alphabet-writing-practice-sheets/</a><br /><br />The Singing Walrus creates fun teaching materials, such as kids songs, educational games, nursery rhymes, and kindergarten worksheets (e.g. handwriting worksheets) for parents and teachers.
