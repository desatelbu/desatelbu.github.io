{% raw %}David Bellamy arrived on the music scene in early 1974 when Jim Stafford took his song &quot;Spiders &amp; Snakes&quot; to #3. Stafford's manager, Phil Gernhard, took an interest in Bellamy and had him record lead vocals on a Larry Williams composition called &quot;Let Your Love Flow&quot;. The result was less than satisfying and the song was shelved. Stafford went to Florida to tape a TV special, and trying to beat a threatening storm that was on the way Gernherd had the roadies perform a sound check before Stafford arrived to save time. Gernhard was discussing the set up with Tony Scotti when he became aware of a roadie singing the sound check. He realized he had found the voice that could carry &quot;Let Your Love Flow&quot; and was surprised to find that it was Larry Bellamy, David's brother. Gernhard had hired Larry as a roadie. Once the tour was completed, Gernhard took Larry &amp; David into the studio and re-recorded &quot;Let Your Love Flow&quot;. On the final day of production, he found out that ABC Dunhill was getting ready to release a cover of the same song. Warner rushed out the release on January 31, 1976 and it hit #1 on May 1, 1976. Mismanagement nearly broke them, but the Brothers regrouped and focused on recording country music with hit songs like 'If I Said You A Beautiful Body (Would You Hold It Against Me)&quot; and made a successful career for themselves to this day.{% endraw %}
