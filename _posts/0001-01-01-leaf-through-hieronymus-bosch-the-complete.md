{% raw %}A leaf through Hieronymus Bosch. The Complete Works published by TASCHEN<br />One of the most enigmatic artists in history, Netherlandish painter Hieronymus Bosch (c. 1450--1516) was something of a Renaissance radical. Turning his back on the realist preferences of contemporary painting, he created fantastical panel pictures, characterised by grotesque creatures, disturbing details, and strange visual symbolism. For some, his puzzling, often macabre, imagery was the vision of a dangerous sexual libertine. <br />The book features brand new photography of recently restored paintings this comprehensive book includes each known Bosch work on an unprecedented scale. Copious details and a fold-out spread over one meter long allow readers to discover the many intricacies of Bosch's elaborate universe.
