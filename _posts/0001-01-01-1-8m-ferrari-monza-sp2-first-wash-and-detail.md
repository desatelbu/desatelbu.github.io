{% raw %}This is a Ferrari Monza SP2 (2 seater) produced in 2019 and costs approximately $1.8 million. Clearly this does not have a roof, so washing it with water is not a realistic option. Instead, I used Frothe from the wall mounted Pro Foamer. This set up is for fixed-based locations that use Frothe on a daily basis. I will have more info on this waterless wash system soon.  Although not a disaster nor disgusting detail, the paint did have some scratches that required a full paint correction and then clear bra. Once done we applied AMMO Reflex Pro to the exterior for insane reflection and Gelee Pro to the wheels for long term protection. For a full list of products visit www.ammonyc.com.
