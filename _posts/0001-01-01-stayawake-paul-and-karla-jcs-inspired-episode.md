{% raw %}Episode Ten of STAYAWAKE is here!! <br /><br />Skip musical intro: @1:06<br />Skip musical intro and psychology introduction: @3:44<br /><br />Full Paul Bernardo interview: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLTAjW5Twlk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLTAjW5Twlk</a><br /><br />WARNING - This episode has graphic narration and emotionally disturbing information.<br /><br />This is the very famous case of Paul Bernardo and Karla Homolka. This is by far my most narrative driven episode and certain aspects of this episode are definitely my favourite work so far.<br /><br />However since this case is so well known and publicized; I am definitely understanding that there may be some facts that I will have to update in a future release. So as usual please notify me of anything you may notice that I should double fact-check before my next re-release :)<br /><br />Thank you again for watching!<br /><br />If you or anybody you know is currently a victim of domestic abuse,  PLEASE reach out for help.<br /><br />Online Domestic Violence resources:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.liveyourdream.org/get-help/domestic-violence-resources.html?utm_term=&amp;utm_campaign=DSA&amp;utm_source=adwords&amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;hsa_acc=3468286777&amp;hsa_cam=1028813436&amp;hsa_mt=b&amp;hsa_net=adwords&amp;hsa_src=g&amp;hsa_ver=3&amp;hsa_ad=243315305222&amp;hsa_tgt=dsa-393349388571&amp;hsa_grp=54252895567&amp;hsa_kw=">https://www.liveyourdream.org/get-help/domestic-violence-resources.html?utm_term=&amp;utm_campaign=DSA&amp;utm_source=adwords&amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;hsa_acc=3468286777&amp;hsa_cam=1028813436&amp;hsa_mt=b&amp;hsa_net=adwords&amp;hsa_src=g&amp;hsa_ver=3&amp;hsa_ad=243315305222&amp;hsa_tgt=dsa-393349388571&amp;hsa_grp=54252895567&amp;hsa_kw=</a><br /><br />CORRECTIONS:<br /><br />It appears that the recent photo of Paul may not actually even be Paul! It turns out that this picture is also linked to another criminal that goes by the name &quot;Mark Marek&quot;. I personally had my doubts on this being Paul due to the eyebrow shape - but I was able to find numerous sources that appeared to be using this picture along with an article about Paul: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.narcity.com/canadian-serial-killer-paul-bernardo-was-just-charged-with-new-crime-while-in-prison">https://www.narcity.com/canadian-serial-killer-paul-bernardo-was-just-charged-with-new-crime-while-in-prison</a> , <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.psycho-criminologie.com/2018/09/paul-bernardo-le-violeur-de-scarborough.html">https://www.psycho-criminologie.com/2018/09/paul-bernardo-le-violeur-de-scarborough.html</a> , <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.change.org/p/amazon-com-tell-amazon-profiting-from-a-rapist-murderer-is-not-ok-appalling-and-disgusting-amazon-publishing-a-book-by-paul-bernardo-the-serial-killer">https://www.change.org/p/amazon-com-tell-amazon-profiting-from-a-rapist-murderer-is-not-ok-appalling-and-disgusting-amazon-publishing-a-book-by-paul-bernardo-the-serial-killer</a> , <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pinterest.ca/pin/864268984724792814/">https://www.pinterest.ca/pin/864268984724792814/</a><br /><br />After side by side comparison, I was absolutely convinced it was him. Unfortunately, If this picture actually is not Paul - the next most recent picture of him is likely used in the doc in other places, as any other searches only bring up court room sketches: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/teen-killer-and-serial-rapist-paul-bernardo-again-denied-parole-1.5480350">https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/teen-killer-and-serial-rapist-paul-bernardo-again-denied-parole-1.5480350</a> , <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.iheartradio.ca/newstalk-1010/news/paul-bernardo-s-parole-denied-1.8504957">https://www.iheartradio.ca/newstalk-1010/news/paul-bernardo-s-parole-denied-1.8504957</a> <br /><br />I will definitely correct this in a rerelease and I genuinely apologize about the confusion!<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />How do you feel about this case?
