If you wanted to check out Acorn TV and try it FREE for 30 days, make sure you head to: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.acorn.tv">https://www.acorn.tv</a> and use my code &quot;rachel&quot; (all lowercase!)<br />Thank you so much Acorn TV for sponsoring this house tour!<br /><br />ANOTHER HOME TOUR! I wanted to make sure I got this filmed before we do any major work on the house so I can look back at it and go &quot;aww&quot; or something, I don't know lol. I just wanted to show you all the new place and what we plan to do with it! Thank you all so so so much for watching my videos, without you I don't think I would have been able to live here, and I am always so eternally grateful. OK ENJOY!! <br /><br />Insta: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/rachel.maksy/">https://www.instagram.com/rachel.maksy/</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/rachelmaksy/">https://www.facebook.com/rachelmaksy/</a><br />Merch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/rachel-maksy">https://teespring.com/stores/rachel-maksy</a><br />TikTok: @rachelmaksy{% endraw %}
