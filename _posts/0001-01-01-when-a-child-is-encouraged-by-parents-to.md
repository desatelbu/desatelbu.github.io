{% raw %}A beautiful moment of a child quickly overcoming fear/discomfort. Throughout the visit, Emma's parents created a supportive, positive environment that we as a team were able to continue to build off of. At end of visit, the strong taste/texture of fluoride varnish upset Emma, but she was encouraged to express herself - as seen here. Compassionate parenting followed by addressing a solution together. I am constantly learning from our patients' parents - such a magical sequence of events!<br />.<br />THANKS FOR WATCHING,<br />DR JOHN YOO<br />.<br />Our lovely patient:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/alainsitohoya/">https://www.instagram.com/alainsitohoya/</a><br />Thank you for a wonderful visit ~ exemplary parenting! <br />We were blown away by the example you set.<br />.<br />Beam City Dental - 🦄🦄🦄<br />Fort Lee, NJ<br />Grand Opening specials on all orthodontics (all ages), and all new pediatric patients welcome ~<br />www.beamcitydental.com<br />Online scheduler:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://beamcitybooking.as.me/schedule.php">https://beamcitybooking.as.me/schedule.php</a><br />.<br />IG:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/dr.johnyoo">https://www.instagram.com/dr.johnyoo</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/beamcitydental">https://www.instagram.com/beamcitydental</a><br /><br />#pediatricdentistry #dentistry #pediatricdentist #nyc #nj #뉴욕 #소아치과 #소아 #치과의사 #reels #dentist #beamcitydental #orthodontics{% endraw %}
