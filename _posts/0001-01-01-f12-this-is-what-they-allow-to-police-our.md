{% raw %}This is F12 he spent the day trying to antagonise people standing against water charges and water meters. <br />He likes to insult people and berate them and attempted to pick on myself. <br />He came over to say Derek you have an injunction and you will be getting lifted. It was pointed out that i hadn`t broken the injunction as i was standing on the path. So in his infinite wisdom he makes an allegation that i am kicking him. <br />So naturally you would expect me to be arrested for assault ? But no i wasn`t, So i point out that he is just a liar. <br />Later on of camera he had another go , So in front of his inspector i held out my hands and told him to arrest me as he claims i kicked him. But i did warn him i had him recorded and would be giving video to my solicitor. Hmmmm Disappeared quickly to pick on children cycling bikes. <br /><br /><br />A BLOODY COWARD AND A DISGRACE TO THE BADGE{% endraw %}
