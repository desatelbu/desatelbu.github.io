{% raw %}Feel two inches taller with this stretching and lengthening class! <br /><br />Join Vicky, Physiotherapist and Pilates Instructor for this stretching and lengthening Pilates class.<br /><br />We start the class in sitting gently stretching and opening up through our neck and upper body. <br /><br />We then move down onto the mat onto our backs to challenge our core control and pelvic stability with some great lengthening movements like a double leg stretch. <br /><br />We then stretch out our glute and hamstrings muscles on our backs. We move onto our sides to work our glutes with a clam movement before opening out through our chests and upper back with an arm opening movement. <br /><br />Finishing our class back in sitting with a mermaid stretch.<br /><br />Interested in more free Pilates?
