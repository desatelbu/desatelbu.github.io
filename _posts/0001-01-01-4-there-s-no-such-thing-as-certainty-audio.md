There's No Such Thing As Certainty (Track) - There's No Such Thing As Certainty (EP)<br />Released 18/06/2021<br /><br />Lyrics:<br /><br />My mind is lost in this<br />So many feelings torn apart<br />That’s just the way it is<br />Trying hard to make sense of it<br />They say things happen for a reason<br />Is the reason always worth it?<br /><br />Why does it come to this?<br />I’ve got no sense of inner strength <br />And yet I feel so tense<br />Trying hard to make sense of it <br />They say things happen for a reason<br />Is the reason always worth it?<br /><br />Shackled down the pain is force fed to me<br />Grief placed like a lens over my eyes<br />Hard to have faith when it’s all so normal<br />I feel alone despite these people by my side<br />It cuts me deep to say goodbye for a lifetime <br />We must go on but each step feels like a mile<br />Hard to have faith when it’s all so normal<br />I just wish, I just wish that I could see your smile<br /><br />But I will rise as this world keeps turning<br />This savage land won’t stop for anyone <br /><br />Now in this life I’m certain<br />That there’s no such thing as certainty<br />No guarantee of anything<br />But birth and death you must agree<br />We’ve got to find the beauty <br />In the simple things like you and me<br />Don’t take these things for granted<br />Because there’s so much stuff we can’t foresee <br /><br />There’s so much stuff we can’t foresee <br /><br />Now in this life I’m certain<br />That there’s no such thing as certainty<br />No guarantee of anything <br />But birth and death you must agree<br />It’s hard to come to terms<br />When these things happen in their different ways<br />Your memory will live on<br />As I try my best to seize the day<br /><br /><br /><br />EP tracklist:<br /><br />1.
