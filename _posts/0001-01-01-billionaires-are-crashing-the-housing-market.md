Housing has always and will always be key to us as humans. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that housing-related spending such as construction, refurbishments and repairs, account for one-sixth of the US and Euro-area economies and are among the largest components of their respective GDPs. Mortgages and other housing-related lending are a big part of banksâ€™ assets in many countries, so changes in house prices affect the health of the banking system, and when they collapse, as we saw from 2006 to 2008, the impact of this damage is felt globally. Itâ€™s common knowledge that the US Housing market has been in overdrive during the last 18 months, since the onset of the COVID19 pandemic. Giant Hedge Funds, Private Equity Firms, and Banks from Wall Street are on a shopping spree and are buying homes by the thousands across the country. While in the past the demand for real estate in the country was through the roof, it seems now that the weather might be changing. Today, Iâ€™m going to demystify the speculation surrounding the US housing market. Why are homes costlier than ever? Why this sudden increase in interest from Wall Street in housing? Is this a bubble? In this video, weâ€™re going to answer these questions, and take a deep dive into the housing economy.<br /><br />DISCLAIMERS:<br />Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for &quot;fair use&quot; for purposes such as criticism, commenting, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
