Carson Daly returns as host. The show's innovative format features four stages of competition: Blind Auditions, Battle Rounds, Knockouts, and Live Performance Shows.<br /><br />This season's Battle Advisors include Jason Aldean (Team Kelly), Kristin Chenoweth (Team Ariana), Camila Cabello (Team Legend), and Dierks Bentley (Team Blake). For the Knockouts, one superstar Mega Mentor will work with all the coaches and their teams.<br /><br />In the Live Performance Shows, the top artists will compete against each other weekly during a live broadcast, and the television audience will vote to save their favorite artists. In the end, one artist will be named &quot;The Voice&quot; and receive the grand prize of a recording contract.<br /><br />Former Coach Alicia Keys Performs &quot;Old Memories&quot; | NBC's The Voice Live Finale 2021<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/K3Mwr9emB34">https://youtu.be/K3Mwr9emB34</a><br /><br />The Voice<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/nbcthevoice">http://www.youtube.com/user/nbcthevoice</a>{% endraw %}
