News has just been released that #TikTok has partnered with its top creators to release an #NFT creation. I’ve been saying from the start that NFTs will be the catalyst for mainstream adoption, and it looks as if this space is hellbent on not making me out to be a liar. This is the second major company this week to release a huge NFT adoption announcement. Yesterday we talked about #Twitter integrating NFT verification into their platform. TikTok must have taken that as a challenge to release its own bullish news. <br /><br />Yesterday, the declaration was also made that NFTs are still bringing the best gains in crypto. At the rate things are going, it looks like things are only going to expand. Am I saying that there won’t ever be any rain in the future? Absolutely not. Everything has its cycles, and this industry is very narrative based. However, the narrative has been NFT driven for most of the year. I plan to continue to take advantage of the sunshine while it’s here. It’s up to you all to determine how to proceed forward.<br /><br />00:00 = Intro<br />01:20 = TikTok announces NFT collection<br />03:48 = SupDucks KingFrog drop<br />05:49 = Metahero Planets launch<br />08:00 = Nifty League Degens<br />10:21 = Outro<br /><br />DISCLAIMER: This is not financial advice!
