RENT is based on Jonathan Larson's Pulitzer and Tony Award-winning musical, one of the longest-running shows on Broadway. The raw and riveting musical stars Rosario Dawson, Taye Diggs, Wilson Jermaine Heredia, Jesse L. Martin, Idina Menzel, Adam Pascal, Anthony Rapp, and Tracie Thoms and is directed by Chris Columbus.<br /><br />#Rent #Sony #RosarioDawson #JesseLMartin #IdinaMenzel #TayeDiggs{% endraw %}
