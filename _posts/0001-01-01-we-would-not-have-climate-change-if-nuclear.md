{% raw %}If nuclear technology had been embraced decades ago, &quot;we would not have climate change,&quot; according to a former UK Extinction Rebellion activist, Zion Lights. <br /><br />Ms Lights, an activist with UK pro-nuclear environmental group, Emergency Reactor, spoke to Sky News Australia about her care for planet Earth.<br /><br />&quot;A key part of protecting the natural environment for my children is nuclear energy, that is just a fact.&quot;<br /><br />Ms Lights said she is finding that younger people are &quot;very, very open to any solution that's presented to them because they're very worried about climate change&quot;. <br /><br />&quot;They want to see solutions and they don't tend to be anti-tech like the kind of older boomer generation of environmentalists.<br /><br />&quot;Frankly, those environmentalists have failed us.<br /><br />&quot;If we had embraced nuclear technology decades ago, frankly, we would not have climate change.&quot; <br /><br />You can stream Sky News Australia live and watch programs on demand with Flash.
