{% raw %}In this installment, I am going to primarily focus on what is called public art that is highly visible, and is quite bizarre, if not downright disturbing, as well as looking at more places viewers' have suggested.  I am working my way through the long list of comments I have received from you.<br /> <br />This will be an on-going series, and it will take me awhile to go through the long list of what I have received so far, so if you have left a comment, or emailed me a suggestion, please bear with me as I work my way through them, and all the connections that I find a long with them!<br /><br />Feel free to post a reminder comment if you haven't seen yours yet, to make I sure I have it on my list!{% endraw %}
