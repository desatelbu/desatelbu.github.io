{% raw %}Published video of testing a new hypersonic missile<br /><br />There was a video of testing a new hypersonic missile. A video of testing a new hypersonic missile has leaked online. Despite the fact that the survey was carried out from a distance of several hundred kilometers, you can see that the rocket develops a tremendous speed - according to various estimates, it could reach 8-10 MAX. A test launch of the rocket was made on December 11, 2021. At the moment, it is known that the development of the rocket was relatively recent and this is its first test launch. This is already at least the sixth version of the Chinese hypersonic missile and indicates that the PRC is actively developing hypersonic technologies. The video footage shows the launch of a hypersonic missile from a military training ground in Shaanxi province. The trail formed behind the rocket could be observed from a distance of several hundred kilometers, however, what is remarkable is that to date this is the first video that demonstrates the real flight speed of a hypersonic rocket. “If we compare the flight speed of a Chinese hypersonic missile with the speed of a passenger airliner at a similar shooting distance, then the civilian plane will practically stand still, although in the published video frames you can see that the rocket is moving very rapidly. The estimated speed can reach 10 MAX, but, obviously, Beijing will not disclose objective data , &quot;the specialist notes. The Pentagon says China has also accelerated the production of nuclear warheads, which could be carried by a hypersonic missile as well as conventional submarine and land-based ballistic missiles. Hyten told CBS News last week that the July hypersonic test, and a second one three weeks later, “should create a sense of urgency” in the US.<br /><br />#OrangeSide  #IranNews #IsraelNews #IranIsraelTension #IranIsraelNews{% endraw %}
