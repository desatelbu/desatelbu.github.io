They carried out detailed reconnaissance for every job they did.<br />But what they didnâ€™t account for as part of their planning were the detectives who were to hunt them down, identify them and bring them back to the UK.<br />In fact, they were so confident in their ability to evade justice that all three of them individually praised us for working out who they were and locating them.<br />â€œWe are pleased they are now behind bars and that their plans to commit further crimes in England and further afield have been disrupted.<br /><br />Jovanovic, Donati and Maltese all flew into the UK just days before committing their first burglary, stealing goods worth a total of around Â£60,000, at an address in Kensington and Chelsea on 1 December 2019.<br /><br />Victim impact statements<br />Frank Lampard<br />I would say that this incident has had a major impact on our general feeling of security, particularly with having a 16 month old baby. The fact that my job means that I travel frequently again raises my concerns. Neither my wife nor I are sleeping too well as a consequence of this incident. I would add that while I have been an unfortunate victim of a crime previously, particularly burglary, this incident has had a far greater impact on our lives.<br />Christine Lampard<br />Since this break in at my house, I am much more fearful of being alone in my own home, I am less trusting of visitors to the house and feel unsafe in my home. I have a young daughter and feel vulnerable in a home which I had previously always felt safe and happy in. I have struggled to sleep sometimes since the incident as I am sensitive to any noise from outside fearing another attack.<br /><br />ðŸ”´ Follow Scarcity on socials ðŸ”´  <br />ðŸŸª Insta: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/ScarcityInsta">https://bit.ly/ScarcityInsta</a> ðŸŸª<br />ðŸŸ¥ Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/ScarcityFB">https://bit.ly/ScarcityFB</a> ðŸŸ¥<br />ðŸŸ¦Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/ScarcityTwitter">https://bit.ly/ScarcityTwitter</a> ðŸŸ¦<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.scarcity-studios.com">https://www.scarcity-studios.com</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1XI4TFW_nEY4IFfTxUUkCg/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1XI4TFW_nEY4IFfTxUUkCg/join</a><br /><br />Alpha Claims and Hire are Birmingham's leading accident management company specialising in non-fault claims. <br /><br />Are you a taxi driver?<br />Have you been involved in a accident?<br />Do you need a accident replacement car?<br /><br />Call us on: 0121 327 0382<br /><br />We stock cars for Birmingham, Wolverhampton, Solihull, Walsall Councils, and many more councils across the UK.<br />Alpha claims and hire stocks euro 6, clean air zone compliant cars. <br /><br /><br />************************************************<br /><br />Alpha claims and hire opened its doors in 2009.
