{% raw %}First off , I DO NOT OWN THIS VIDEO.  ALL RIGHTS AND RESPECT GOES TO THE RIGHTFUL  OWNERS!<br />Hilarious scene from the &quot;American Hustle&quot;.The film opens with Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale ) as he stands in front of a mirror, putting together the most elaborate combover,.He painstakingly applies glue, toupee  and then finishes off with that elaborated  comb over. Shortly after, he  meets Sydney (Amy Adams) and   FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Cooper) who he gets  into a nasty argument with  and  that is when Richie knocks Irving's hair out of place. This is probably one of the  best hilarious  scene from the film. Loved the trio's reaction just after Richie messes Irving's hair ...esp loved CB's expression.<br />P.S Please watch  in HD ,{% endraw %}
