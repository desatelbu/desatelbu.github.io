{% raw %}You'd be surprised how kind strangers can be when given the opportunity. Leon Logothetis learned this firsthand when he set off on a worldwide journey four years ago with no money, food, gas, or even a place to stay, relying on the kindness of strangers to help him. His journey is documented in &quot;The Kindness Diaries&quot; streaming on Discovery+, and includes his stay with Karen Rodriguez, who runs Code in Color, an ed-tech organization that connects young people of color to tech education and job opportunities.<br /><br />#KellyClarksonShow #LeonLogothetis<br /><br />Subscribe to The Kelly Clarkson Show: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2OtOpf8">https://bit.ly/2OtOpf8</a><br /> <br />FOLLOW US<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/kellyclarksonshow/">https://www.instagram.com/kellyclarksonshow/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/KellyClarksonTV">https://twitter.com/KellyClarksonTV</a> <br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/KellyClarksonShow/">https://www.facebook.com/KellyClarksonShow/</a><br /> <br />For even more fun stuff, visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.kellyclarksonshow.com/">https://www.kellyclarksonshow.com/</a><br /> <br />The Kelly Clarkson Show is the uplifting daytime destination for humor and connection featuring Emmy-winning talk show, Grammy-winning artist and Americaâ€™s original idol, Kelly Clarkson.{% endraw %}
