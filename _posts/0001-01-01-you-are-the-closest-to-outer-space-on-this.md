{% raw %}In this episode I am riding to the Chimborazo volcano in Ecuador. This is a special place, because due to the bulging effect of the earth, you are the closest to outer space (and the furthest from the centre of the earth) when you climb to the top of the volcano. There is a big glacier on the top and unfortunately, clouds covered the top all the time that I was there. Still - an absolute magical place with stunning scenery!<br /><br />Gear &amp; Equipment that I use in this season: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.itchyboots.com/blog/gear-and-equipment-season-6-alaska">https://www.itchyboots.com/blog/gear-and-equipment-season-6-alaska</a><br /><br />Follow my journey on: WWW.ITCHYBOOTS.COM<br />Instagram:   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/itchybootstravel">https://www.instagram.com/itchybootstravel</a><br />Facebook:     <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/itchyboots">https://www.facebook.com/itchyboots</a><br /><br /><br />#itchyboots #adventure #crf300rally{% endraw %}
