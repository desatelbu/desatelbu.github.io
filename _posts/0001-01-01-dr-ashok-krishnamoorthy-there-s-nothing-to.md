{% raw %}Sometimes people are reluctant to reach out, but there are very good treatments available for mental illness and addiction, including medicine, counselling and social supports. Individual recovery looks different for each person so we have a variety of programs in Richmond to match different needs. With good assessment and treatment we can support people to lead meaningful, satisfying and rewarding lives at any age. There is nothing to be embarrassed of!<br />Learn more about mental health services available in the community and at Richmond Hospital: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/RichmondMHservices">https://bit.ly/RichmondMHservices</a> .{% endraw %}
