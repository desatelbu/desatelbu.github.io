{% raw %}This Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency trading analysis applies to various exchanges, including Bybit and Binance. Tackling questions like if Bitcoin can reach all time highs again or how low BTC will crash. Things like the lightning network have provided huge improvements for BTC and while it is true that others like Roger Ver with Bitcoin Cash (bcash) may disagree, I do see these blockchain technology innovations to be very bullish fundamental signs for the space. <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://t.me/forfliesgold">https://t.me/forfliesgold</a><br />To join VIP, click on my name (@Forflies) at the bottom of Telegram posts and message me.

I am not liable for any losses you may incur when trading crypto, always do your own research (DYOR).<br />Contracts for Difference (&quot;CFDs&quot;) are leveraged products and carry a significant risk of loss to your capital, as prices may move rapidly against you and you may be required to make further payments to keep any trades open. Between 74-89% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs. These products are not suitable for all clients, therefore please ensure you fully understand the risks and seek independent advice.<br /><br />- Sami Loyal{% endraw %}
