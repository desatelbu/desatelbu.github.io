{% raw %}ðŸš‚ Niko's SURPRISE is HERE!! ðŸšƒ<br />This is an ad for Fisher-Price #ad<br /><br />LET'S BE FRIENDS -- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/a7ctjJ">https://goo.gl/a7ctjJ</a><br /><br />HEY EVERYBODY!! ALL ABOARD the Surprise Train!! Iâ€™ve been waiting to surprise Niko for so long and today is the day! Iâ€™ve started school and that means that Niko and I canâ€™t play together during the day anymore. I donâ€™t want him to be bored, so I got him something that I know heâ€™s going to love, a Thomas &amp; Friends Trains &amp; Cranes Super Tower!! He loves trains and I know he was going to love it!! When it arrived at our house, Dad and I made sure that Niko was distracted outside so that we could build his new toy! We worked together so that we could get it done really fast!! After it was built we brought him inside and surprised him with his new train set!! It was the ultimate surprise!! He had no idea, and was so excited!! He ran in instantly started to play with the trains, cranes, and helicopter!! We had so much fun playing together and acting out a story!! THEN dad told us another surprise, he got more track so we could make our play area even bigger!! We set up the extra track and had our trains drive all over our living room!! Niko loved his surprise and we had the best day ever!! If you want to get your very own Thomas &amp; Friends Trains &amp; Cranes Super Tower you can find it at Target, Amazon, and Walmart!!<br /><br />Bye Vlog <br />*psssssshh*{% endraw %}
