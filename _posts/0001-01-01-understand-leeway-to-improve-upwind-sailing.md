{% raw %}Leeway is the distance (or angle) a boat drifts off course to leeward due to the sideways force of the wind. Notice the boat ‘s bow is pointing toward the mark but the boat is slipping to leeward. This is because the wind is pushing the boat sideways.  The angle between the boat’s heading and its actual track through the water is called the leeway angle.<br /><br />Link to the Sailing World article on optimizing the sum of leeway angle plus rudder angle. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.sailingworld.com/how-to/power-positive-rudder-angle/#:~:text=In%20very%20general%20terms%2C%20you,less%20rudder%20angle%20you%20need.">https://www.sailingworld.com/how-to/power-positive-rudder-angle/#:~:text=In%20very%20general%20terms%2C%20you,less%20rudder%20angle%20you%20need.</a><br /><br />Go to SailZing.com for much more on this topic.<br /><br />SAILZING.com is… Stimulating Learning for Sailors. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://SailZing.com​">https://SailZing.com​</a><br /><br />Our mission is to provide the quickest and easiest path for racing sailors to improve their knowledge and skills.<br /><br />Follow us: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rumble.com/c/SailZing/​">https://rumble.com/c/SailZing/​</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pinterest.com/SailZing/boards">https://pinterest.com/SailZing/boards</a>{% endraw %}
