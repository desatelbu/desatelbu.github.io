Shipping and handling not included in the promo.<br /><br />My Strange Addiction and My Crazy Obsession are shows from TLC that highlights the real life experiences of individuals dealing with addictions, compulsions, and behaviors the average person might consider unusual. While many of these conditions may appear humorous to some, it's important to lead with empathy and recognize these are stories of real people, often times suffering from life-threatening conditions. Today we look at a young woman addicted to drinking gasoline, a man who spends 8 hours a day dressed and behaving like a baby, a girl addicted to eating sand, a man who is romantically in love with his car, a man whose primary diet consists of bugs, a woman obsessed with scavenging for expired food, and the world's strongest family. There's a lot of content in here worth commenting about, but please keep this comment section respectful as we look deeper into the causes and effects of these addictions.<br /><br />Pros and Cons of PCR and Antigen tests: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/resources/antigen-tests-guidelines.html#table1">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/resources/antigen-tests-guidelines.html#table1</a><br /><br />I LOVE reading your comments and take your suggestions seriously.

Additional evidence shows that serial antigen testing every 3 days, or twice per week, will almost always identify SARS-CoV-2 during early stages of infection, and thus significantly reduce disease transmission. Thus, if resources allow, serial antigen testing is a potentially important public health practice along with other prevention strategies.”<br /><br />Help us continue the fight against medical misinformation and change the world through charity by becoming a Doctor Mike Resident on Patreon where every month I donate 100% of the proceeds to the charity, organization, or cause of your choice!
