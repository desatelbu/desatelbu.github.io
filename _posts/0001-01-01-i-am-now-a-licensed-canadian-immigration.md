{% raw %}Hi People,<br />I am now a Regulated Canadian Immigration Consultant (RCIC) and my license number is R534111. To verify, please refer the ICCRC website at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://iccrc-crcic.ca/find-a-professional/">https://iccrc-crcic.ca/find-a-professional/</a><br />Search for my name 'Monish' :) <br /><br />Do not forget to check the website - <br />www.astralimmigration.com <br /><br />I am now legally authorized to help people at any stage of their Canadian Immigration plans/process.  If you do not have time or resources to help yourself or your relatives/friends with their transition plan to Canada then do not hesitate to reach out! <br /><br />This does not mean that my youtube presence would be affected. Everything stays the same:) Infact very happy to help everyone through videos, comment section, social media and at professional level as well.  <br /><br />Thanks for the continued support!{% endraw %}
