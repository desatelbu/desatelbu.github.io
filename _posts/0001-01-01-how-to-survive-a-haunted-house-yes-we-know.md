{% raw %}Yes, we know there's no scientific proof of ghosts, but there are countless reports of hauntings all over the world. According to a 2019 YouGov poll, 45% of Americans believe that ghosts &quot;definitely&quot; or &quot;probably&quot; exist. And the other 55% have obviously never stayed in a haunted house. People in a haunted house may see visual signs including “full-bodied apparitions,&quot; or items that have moved without anyone touching them. So if you walk into the living room and find every thing rearranged, maybe it’s time to call the Ghostbusters. Or someone else. When should you call a medium? What should you do to the mirrors? And how could your spice rack save your home?<br /><br />00:00 Intro<br />03:13 Step 1: Go big or Go medium  <br />03:53 Step 2: Don't clown around<br />04:27 Step 3: Cover the mirrors <br />04:45 Step 4: Stay with others  <br />05:10 Step 5: Wear sensible shoes <br /><br />Transcript and sources: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://whatifshow.com/how-to-survive-a-haunted-house/">https://whatifshow.com/how-to-survive-a-haunted-house/</a><br /><br />Questions or concerns?
