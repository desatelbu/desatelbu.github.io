{% raw %}Music is your passion, but you're probably not good enough to turn it into a career. The people who you hear on the radio and see on TV receiving all the major awards had connections and lots of money to begin with and that's why they are where they are. Drake and Taylor Swift don't focus on social media or responding to DM's and they are rich and famous...so why would have to do those things? Sound familiar? People think that they will somehow do music as a career with one part of their brain and then the other side is consumed with statements like I just made. If you agreed with anything I said earlier then you might be one of those people who are suffering from the virus. This is how to make sure you aren't poisoning your own water supply. <br /><br />Want to work with me one-on-one?
