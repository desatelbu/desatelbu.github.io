{% raw %}4 years ago we quit our jobs, sold our house and got rid of almost everything we owned.  Do we regret our decision?<br /><br />In this video we're talking about the pros and cons of our minimalist nomad lifestyle and whether we have any regrets about our decision to go against the grain, quit the rat race, and try something new.<br /><br />On the positive side, our new lifestyle has allowed us to travel, spend more time together, start our own business, and have more free time.<br /><br />On the downside, we have no investments, no retirement plan, and we're constantly on the move.  We also feel that some of our friendships have suffered by our frequent absences.<br /><br />If we had the choice to go back to our previous lifestyle, we both would say no.  Despite the many challenges and moments of self-doubt, we'd both still choose to be minimalist digital nomads with the freedom to travel long-term.  We'll let you know if and when that changes!<br /><br />Thanks for watching!<br /><br />Mat &amp; Danielle<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------<br />STAY IN TOUCH!<br />------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Blog: www.exploringalternatives.ca<br />Facebook: /exploringalternativesblog<br />Instagram: @exploringalternatives<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------<br />COMMENTS<br />-------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />We want our channel and our comments section to be an inclusive space where everyone feels welcome to watch and to contribute.
