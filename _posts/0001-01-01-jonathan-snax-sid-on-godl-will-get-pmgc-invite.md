{% raw %}In a surprising development from the side of PUBG Mobile esports, the much talked about special invite to the PUBG Mobile Global Championship 2021 (PMGC 2021) will go to an Indian team. This news brought a wave of happiness among the Indian esports fans waiting to see Indian teams go up against the global teams.<br /><br />The PMGC 2021 boasts a massive prize pool of USD 6 Million and has been divided into three stages; The East and the West Leagues and the Grand Finals. 40 Teams will play in the League Stage of the competition, with teams equally divided among the east and west (20 teams per league).<br /><br />Teams from the East and the West Leagues will battle separately but simultaneously over three weeks to qualify for their respective league finals. 16 out of the 20 teams in each league will be eligible for the respective League Finals. 9 Teams from the East League Finals while six teams from the West League Finals will eventually qualify for the Grand Finals, which are scheduled to be held from the 21st to the 23rd of January 2022. These teams will be joined by a specially invited 16th Indian team.<br /><br />This will be the first time since the PUBG Mobile World League (PMWL: 2020) that an Indian team will compete globally. In the PMWL: East 2020, the Indian squad of OREsports secured the 2nd spot among top teams from the East region. Indian teams were not Invited to the PMGC: 2020 due to the ban of PUBG Mobile in India during that period.<br /><br />It would also be interesting to witness which team gets the invite to the finals, with the final of BGIS: 2021 (The first Indian major event since the release of BGMI) scheduled to end on the 16th of January 2022. Some speculations that the slot will go to the winner are there in the market, although no official announcement regarding this has been made yet.<br /><br />@Snax Gaming , @SID , @ZooTay , @JONATHAN GAMING and @sc0ut also reacts on which team will get PMGC 2021 special invite <br /><br />zootay - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZESsBo5qeb0&amp;t=48s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZESsBo5qeb0&amp;t=48s</a><br /><br />My second channel - <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCewBZNMJOn7bnhFsHH4CShA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCewBZNMJOn7bnhFsHH4CShA</a><br /><br />Sponsored By - <br />Extra0rdinnary is sponsored by GemWire - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/gemwire.gg/">https://www.instagram.com/gemwire.gg/</a><br /><br />BECOME CHANNEL MEMBERS - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJLFsRmpJtYMvEjoxgl0fEw/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJLFsRmpJtYMvEjoxgl0fEw/join</a><br /><br />Contact And Follow me on -   <br /><br />Follow me on Instagram  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/extra_0rdinnary/">https://www.instagram.com/extra_0rdinnary/</a><br />Follow me on Facebook  - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Extraordinary997">https://www.facebook.com/Extraordinary997</a><br />Follow me on Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/EoOfficial99">https://twitter.com/EoOfficial99</a><br />My DISCORD - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/X8fFZYg">https://discord.gg/X8fFZYg</a><br />You Can Send Me News on Instagram. <br /><br />About My channel -<br /><br />Extra0rdinnary is an esports and gaming news platform that puts a focus on pro players, teams, creators, and the games that make it all possible. <br /><br />DISCLAIMER -<br />If you need a song removed on my channel, please message me on Instagram . <br />Â© Copyright: We / I do not own any of the material in this video.<br />I upload videos for promotional and preview purposes only!<br />If you are the Producer or Photographer and would like the Video taken down please Email me and we / I shall remove it immediately.<br />Please do not issue a &quot;Copyright Strike&quot; against the Channel as it affects all previous work.
