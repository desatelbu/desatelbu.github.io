{% raw %}This method takes advantage of Tempoross' special attacks being disabled at 4% energy. You then fish and cook 2 inventories ready for phases 4 and 5 when the boss goes out of control. Loading both cannons equally with enough fish will down the boss before it enrages, this gives you a little more time to get more fish for more points.<br /><br />This was done with 85 fishing and a dragon harpoon.{% endraw %}
