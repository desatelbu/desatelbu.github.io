The formality of corporate worship gave way to ‚Äòintimacy‚Äô, and we were forever changed. The ongoing work of the Spirit released us into a ‚Äòa spiritual intensity‚Äô, but our ultimate longing has always been a weighty encounter in the presence of God that is less about our contribution and more about our surrender. Integrity Music‚Äôs REVERE is a musical journey from intimacy to intensity into the fear of the Lord, where we fall down and cry out: ‚ÄúHoly, holy, holy are you Lord Almighty.‚Äù<br /><br />The entire project was drenched in a vision to gently help steer the church away from a production culture where the emphasis can, mistakenly, become a love for worship, to a reverential culture where the focus is, clearly and firmly, a love for Christ. REVERE's vision is to help the body of Christ become a collaborative priesthood, a community of worship leaders led the event as a team, championing songs that they had not written themselves. Darlene Zschech and William McDowell took the lead on Way Maker which was written by Nigeria‚Äôs Sinach, popularized in the US by Leeland, and currently nominated for three Dove Awards. A first for a song from Africa. Duo, Mission House, led ‚ÄòBehold Him‚Äô which was written by Paul Baloche. And this was the culture of the event from the beginning to the end. Leeland, Corey Voss, Sarah Kroger, Jon Egan, Benita Jones, Lindy Cofer, Thrive Worship, Mark Barlow, DOE, MDSN, and David &amp; Nicole Binion all jumped in as servants and the result was heart-wrenching. <br /><br />‚Äé‚ñ∂ Listen to the full album: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://revere.lnk.to/REVEREyt">http://revere.lnk.to/REVEREyt</a><br />‚ñ∂ Listen on Apple Music: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://Revere.lnk.to/REVEREYT/applemusic">https://Revere.lnk.to/REVEREYT/applemusic</a><br />‚ñ∂ Listen on Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://Revere.lnk.to/REVEREYT/spotify">https://Revere.lnk.to/REVEREYT/spotify</a><br />‚ñ∂ Listen on Amazon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://Revere.lnk.to/REVEREYT/amazonmusic">https://Revere.lnk.to/REVEREYT/amazonmusic</a><br />‚ñ∂ Listen on Pandora: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://Revere.lnk.to/REVEREYT/pandora">https://Revere.lnk.to/REVEREYT/pandora</a><br />‚ñ∂ Listen on Tidal: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://Revere.lnk.to/REVEREYT/tidal">https://Revere.lnk.to/REVEREYT/tidal</a><br />‚ñ∂ Download on iTunes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://Revere.lnk.to/REVEREYT/itunes">https://Revere.lnk.to/REVEREYT/itunes</a><br /><br />We hope you're using the chat to encourage, have conversations, and build friendships with people around the world.
