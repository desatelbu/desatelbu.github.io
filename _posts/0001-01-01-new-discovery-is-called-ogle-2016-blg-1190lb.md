{% raw %}New discovery is called: OGLE-2016-BLG-1190Lb and is believed to be 13 times larger than Jupiter.<br /><br />The new discovery is called OGLE-2016-BLG-1190Lb and is believed to be more than 13 times larger than Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system. The great planet, with the name even bigger, is 22,000 light-years away, within the galactic bulk, the central core of the galaxy where most of the stars are located. Due to its large mass, it can actually be a brown dwarf. The brown dwarfs are so large that they generate heat, but not so much as to maintain the nuclear fusion used by other stars.<br /><br />Since the existence of the desert of the brown dwarf is the characteristic of the different mechanisms of formation of stars and planets, the extreme proximity of OGLE-2016-BLG-1190Lb to this desert raises the question of whether it really is a planet by mechanism of formation and, therefore, reacts again on its role in monitoring the galactic distribution of planets.{% endraw %}
