{% raw %}Gladys Berejiklian is now &quot;veritably hoisted on her own petard,&quot; according to Sky News host Alan Jones.<br /><br />Ms Berejiklian resigned last week as premier of New South Wales amid news she is being investigated by ICAC.<br /><br />&quot;It is not Gladys Berejiklian who should be in the dock, but ICAC itself,&quot; Mr Jones said.<br /><br />&quot;Yes, we do need a body to investigate corruption in public office, but in many ways the former premier has been hoisted on her own petard.<br /><br />&quot;I can't remember how many times ... I have sought to persuade her government to reform the ICAC machinery, this is an outfit that seems to thrive on the bloodsport of destroying the reputations of high-profile people.<br /><br />&quot;Her government did nothing about it; it is a sadness that she is now veritably hoisted on her own petard.<br /><br />&quot;Berejiklian along with a raft of others before her deserve a public apology.&quot;{% endraw %}
