{% raw %}This is epic!!! We finally have most of the parts for the 2020 Cadillac CT5-V and were getting this sucker put back together. We have been waiting for a couple weeks and now it is go time. The most important pieces were the frame rails and now we have them installed. Now we can move onto getting the body panels ready for paint and it'll be ready for the road! Cant wait, thanks for watching!!!<br /><br />-GOONZQUAD NEW MERCH!!(Very Limited):  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goonzquad.com">https://goonzquad.com</a> <br /><br />-Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/goonzquad/">https://www.instagram.com/goonzquad/</a><br /><br />-Email: goonzquadteam@gmail.com<br /><br />-P.O.
