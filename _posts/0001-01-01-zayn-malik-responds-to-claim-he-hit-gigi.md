{% raw %}Zayn Malik is speaking out after being accused of striking Yolanda Hadid, the mother of his girlfriend, Gigi. A source tells ET, ‘Yolanda and Zayn had a disagreement that turned hostile. Yolanda is telling people around her that Zayn struck her.’ The source adds that Gigi was not present for the alleged incident and she’s been listening to ‘both sides’ of the story. The 28-year-old singer shared a statement to Twitter on Thursday following reports of the alleged altercation. He wrote in part, ‘As you all know I am a private person and I very much want to create a safe and private space for my daughter to grow up in. A place where private family matters aren’t thrown on the world stage for all to poke and pick apart. In an effort to protect that space for her I agreed to not contest claims arising from an argument I had with a family member of my partner’s who entered our home while my partner was away several weeks ago’<br /><br />Exclusives from #EntertainmentTonight :<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQwITQ__CeH2Y_7g2xeiNDa0vQsROQQgv">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQwITQ__CeH2Y_7g2xeiNDa0vQsROQQgv</a>{% endraw %}
