{% raw %}Make sure you meet us here on Thursday, 16 December for a wonderful session. If you have a copy of the 'A Very mainly Christmas' book - bring it. And bring a set of bells and a scarf (a set of keys and a serviette/napkin) too. Plus bring your grown-up so they can participate in the songs with you.<br />See you on Thursday.{% endraw %}
