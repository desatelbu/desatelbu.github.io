His accolades include two Academy Awards and three Golden Globe Awards. Despite media reports that Jennifer Lopez took offense at Affleck's comments related to his ex-wife, Jennifer Garner, during a recent interview with Howard Stern, the singer says the rumors are utterly off-base. &quot;This story is simply not true,&quot; Lopez told PEOPLE magazine. &quot;It is not how I feel.&quot; She adds of Affleck, with whom she rekindled a romantic relationship earlier this year, &quot;I couldn't have more respect for Ben as a father, a co-parent, and a person.&quot; For his part, Affleck, who shares daughters Violet, 16, and Seraphina, 12, and son Samuel, 9, with Garner, also took issue with the narrow focus of coverage of his comments on the Howard Stern Show. During the interview, a wide-ranging and candid discussion about fame, love, parenthood, and his past struggles with alcoholism, the actor spoke of the time in his life when his marriage to Garner was faltering, stating within a larger point, &quot;part of why I started drinking... because I was trapped.&quot;<br /><br />The Behavior Panel is a group made up of the world's top body language and behavior experts, Scott Rouse, Mark Bowden, Chase Hughes and Greg Hartley.
