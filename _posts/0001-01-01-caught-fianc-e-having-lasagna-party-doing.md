{% raw %}#redditstories #redditrelationship #aita<br /><br />(M37, F29) The breakup was about a month and a half ago. She is in medicine, so I was with her through the last 2 years of med school, traveled with her to 6 different cities as she completed externships, internships, and finally settled on a staff position at the beginning of August. This was to be our final move after all of the hard years of her not making much, working insanely long hours, moving and traveling non-stop, etc. <br /><br />Timestaps:<br /><br />0:00 Greetings<br /><br />00:06 - Caught My GF Having Lasagna Party &amp; Doing Green Tea, Dumped Her Immediately.<br /><br />06:04 - My Wife Insisted On Open Relationship To Cheat w/ Her Boss &amp; Ran Away With My Money.<br /><br />12:14 - GirlFriend Accidentally Uncovered Her Own Affair &amp; Used My Money But I Gave Her Ultimatum.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />GreenWhalea@gmail.com{% endraw %}
