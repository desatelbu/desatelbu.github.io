{% raw %}Hello! Thank you so much to everyone for watching my Cape Wrath Series so far, here is EP4 where I hike from Kinloch Hourne after wild camping nearby and heading onto Shiel Bridge to stay the night and finally have a wash haha! After, I set off from Morvich to take on the Falls Of Glomach ( one of Britain's tallest waterfalls) I take a long route onto the lovely, remote Bothy which is Maol Bhuidhe, enjoying a cozy evening with others who are hiking the CWT also. The following day brings me to Craig, after savage conditions with a storm rolling in - I was lucky enough to get permission to camp in the Youth Hostel haha! Some great hiking for these past days, through remote sections of the Scottish Highlands - I hope you enjoy :) <br /><br />Thank you for watching! x<br /><br />Thank you so much to all my patrons for making this possible - Please take a look and support my Patreon Page  - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/girloutdoors">https://www.patreon.com/girloutdoors</a><br /><br />Andrew's channel - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjE8V8RQoKM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjE8V8RQoKM</a><br /><br />Freeze Dried Meals - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://basecampfood.com/collections/dried-meals">https://basecampfood.com/collections/dried-meals</a><br />Titanium Pot and Spoon - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://wildcampinginternational.com/shop">https://wildcampinginternational.com/shop</a><br />Kendal Mint bars affiliate link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.kendalmint.co.uk/?atid=68">https://www.kendalmint.co.uk/?atid=68</a><br />DISCOUNT ( 10% code: girloutdoorsbecky10 )<br />Castrom Knife  - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.casstrom.co.uk/products/safari-mini-hunter-in-black-g10">https://www.casstrom.co.uk/products/safari-mini-hunter-in-black-g10</a><br />Vallon Glasses - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://vallon.store/collections/mens-sunglasses/products/waylons">https://vallon.store/collections/mens-sunglasses/products/waylons</a><br />Jetboil MightyMo - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.burton-mccall.co.uk/brand/jetboil/">https://www.burton-mccall.co.uk/brand/jetboil/</a><br />Down Jacket - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rab.equipment/uk/women-s-electron-pro-jacket">https://rab.equipment/uk/women-s-electron-pro-jacket</a><br />Hiking shoes - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.altrarunning.eu/uk/w-lone-peak-5-2845.html">https://www.altrarunning.eu/uk/w-lone-peak-5-2845.html</a><br />Solar Panel - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.anker.com/ca/products/variant/anker-powerport-solar/A2421011">https://www.anker.com/ca/products/variant/anker-powerport-solar/A2421011</a><br />Camera - SONY ZV1 High Performance Compact Vlogging Camera <br />Go Pro 7 Silver <br /><br />Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/girl_outdoors_becky/">https://www.instagram.com/girl_outdoors_becky/</a><br />Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Girl-Outdoors-398344493957243/">https://www.facebook.com/Girl-Outdoors-398344493957243/</a>{% endraw %}
