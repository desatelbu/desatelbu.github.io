{% raw %}Orig. 12-inch DISCO-Version, 1979. BEST VERSION OF ALL TIME! .HERE COMES THE LYRICS:<br /><br />When they begin the beguine<br />It brings back the sound of music so tender<br />It brings back a night of tropical splendor<br />It brings back a memory ever green<br /><br />I'm with you once more under the stars<br />And down by the shore an orchestra's playing<br />And even the palms seem to be swaying<br />When they begin the beguine<br /><br />To live it again is past all endeavor<br />Except when that tune clutches my heart<br />And there we are, swearing to love forever<br />And promising never, never to part<br /><br />What moments divine, what rapture serene<br />Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted<br />And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted<br />I know but too well what they mean<br /><br />So don't let them begin the beguine<br />Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember<br />Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember<br />When they begin the beguine<br /><br />Let them begin the beguine, make them play<br />Till the stars that were there before return above you<br />Till you whisper to me once more, darling, I love you<br />And we suddenly know what heaven we're in when they begin<br /><br />When they begin the beguine<br />When they begin the beguine<br />When they begin the beguine{% endraw %}
