{% raw %}Tier VII Russian cruiser Shchors is a pretty solid boat.  She has fabulous guns, but - like most Russian light cruisers - is quite fragile.  She doesn't like getting shot at my much of anything, least of all opposing battleships.  This game on Shards sees me doing some really mean things to an opposing Japanese destroyer early, but paying the price for my aggression and having to scramble to contribute in the late game.<br /><br />View the original video here (including the chat): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1183558390">https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1183558390</a><br /><br />In an effort to keep a better flow of content coming, I'm going to pretty up some of my more interesting Twitch games from a given week and share them on the channel. These are much faster to produce than my normal stuff, but are a little less polished.<br /><br />FIND ME ON:<br />Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/SeaRaptorNA">http://www.facebook.com/SeaRaptorNA</a><br />Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/SeaRaptor">https://twitter.com/SeaRaptor</a><br />Twitch Channel - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/searaptor00">https://www.twitch.tv/searaptor00</a><br />YouTube - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/SeaRaptor">http://www.youtube.com/SeaRaptor</a><br />Join the World of Warships! - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://warships.us/searaptor">http://warships.us/searaptor</a><br /><br />#WorldOfWarships{% endraw %}
