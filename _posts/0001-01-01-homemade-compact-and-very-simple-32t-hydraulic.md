{% raw %}So I built hydraulic press used 32 tons hydraulic bottle jack and u profile metal. For plans - width 60cm (23.6in), height 80cm (31.4in), thickness 15cm (6in). Working space about 35cm (14in). In future I will need to upgrade springs, current is too soft. <br />It's simple but very effective and by capacity is compact size.<br /><br /><br />►SUBSCRIBE<br />►LIKE<br />►SHARE<br /><br /><br /><br />► Music – Jim Yosef - Firefly [NCS Release]<br /><br /><br /><br />             Thank you for watching<br />                    ► GetWork ◄{% endraw %}
