{% raw %}Fire &amp; sunshine reggae-rock. 100% conscious.<br /><br />Jay Canter is the creative force driving the reggae-rock band Streetlevel Uprising. Their third album, Sunshine Music, is rich with the social commentary, uplifting affirmations, lively melodies, and fiery grooves that have always defined this band.<br /><br />On record or stage, you notice the horns and vocal harmonies instantly. “Kelli and Greg lifted us to a new level,” Jay says, “and Bill and Zate just have this rare vocal blend.” Jay’s presence – dreads dragging the ground, urgent vocals, and his vibrant and emotive lyrics – lend him a passionate charm.  His message, whether sharply critical or warmly compassionate, is one of togetherness, inviting everyone into his songs through his non-dogmatic approach to social change. “We offer a humanitarian message; human rights, social equality, protection of the environment, farmers’ rights.  It’s not about this party or that party. We’re a conscious band. We’re not a political band.”<br /><br />Throughout the album, Streetlevel Uprising takes on racism, sexism, violence, oppression, and greed. The scorching “This is Babylon” aims squarely at economic disparity and corporate misdeeds. The simmering one drop of “Seams” shines a light on cultural divisiveness and “Change Something” pleads for action against injustice with a chorus of, “If you know something, say something, do something, change something.”<br /><br />While happy with Sunshine Music, Jay is already looking ahead. “We really live for the shows,” he says. That enthusiasm is apparent, with “energy” being the word most often associated with their incendiary live performances. Jay dances and jumps around, massive web of locks flying, while Zate bobs to the music. Bill strolls and grooves around his side of the stage, and Bongo Jae is a conga-pounding madman. “We do try to raise awareness of certain issues. But we love music, we love entertaining, and we love making people happy.”{% endraw %}
