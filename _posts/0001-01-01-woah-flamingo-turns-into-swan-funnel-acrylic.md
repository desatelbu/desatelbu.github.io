{% raw %}A Funnel Pour WITH Papertowel Dip? Worked out amazing! Do you see it?! What a beautiful coincidence.<br />Combining acrylic pouring techniques to start this amazing collaboration with @MOLLY'S ARTISTRY and @Olga Soby ! Together we have an acrylic A to Z Course (www.smartartcourses.com use code: ART20 for 20usd off!) but we never collaborated in our youtube videos. We call it Life in Fluid Color and it is inspired by the amazing docu by David Attenborough on netflix. It is extremely interesting and I would absolutely recommend this. <br />If you would like to join us and get your inspiration from the beautiful colors nature has to offer, use #lifeinfluidcolor so we can see yours too!<br /><br />For his artwork I don't use my blowdryer but try to stay true to my style. I am pouring a background with a funnel and then creating the 'life in color' with a flower dip and a fast spin;-).<br />Loving the result. How fun a swan popped up in this acrylic artwork!<br /><br />Olga Soby video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/iHb2GrfuxjM">https://youtu.be/iHb2GrfuxjM</a><br />Molly's Artistry video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/Kj9KOC22jhg">https://youtu.be/Kj9KOC22jhg</a><br /><br />-------------------------------------------<br /><br />SUPPLIES<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/rinskedouna">https://www.amazon.com/shop/rinskedouna</a><br />‚Äã<br />ACRYLIC POURING A to Z:<br />Get 20usd off with code: ART20<br />Check out our course here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://smartartcourses.com/">https://smartartcourses.com/</a><br />What will you get?<br />üîπÔ∏è Created by 3 ARTISTS ( with @mollysartistry6 @olga_soby and Me)<br />üîπÔ∏è 8+ HOURS of instructional videos<br />üîπÔ∏è Additional TEXT, TIPS, and INSIGHTS<br />üîπÔ∏è LIFETIME Access to course and future updates<br />üîπÔ∏è All you want to know about Acrylic Pouring<br />Happy creating!!!‚ù§<br /><br />Also I‚Äôd very much appreciate any feedback.

Playing with colors, testing out new fluid art techniques, brands, sizes &amp; collaborating with other abstract fluid artists; is the best. Since I started this journey I feel more balanced in my work and passion. If you see these fluid painting tutorials and feel like, this is something for me: go for it! The fun thing about fluid painting is, that even though you do exactly the same, the outcome is different everytime. Also everybody has a different view of composition, colorcombinations and the way of doing a technique, what makes and keeps it so interesting to watch. Thank you for watching and following me in my modern art journey! <br /><br />More about rinske douna: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rinskedouna.com/">https://rinskedouna.com/</a><br />Art for sale: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rinskedouna.com/shop/">https://rinskedouna.com/shop/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/rinskedouna">https://www.instagram.com/rinskedouna</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/rinskedouna.art">https://www.facebook.com/rinskedouna.art</a><br />Amazon store: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/rinskedouna">https://www.amazon.com/shop/rinskedouna</a><br />Merchandise: teespring.com/nl/stores/rinske-douna<br /><br />Rinske is an amazon  affiliate and receives a small commission on the sales at no extra cost for you!<br /><br />#acrylicpouring‚Äã‚Äã #rinskedouna‚Äã #acrylicpainting{% endraw %}
