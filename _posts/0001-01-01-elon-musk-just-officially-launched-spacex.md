And it‚Äôs highly possible that Elon Musk would like to revolutionize space manufacturing in his next plan. Meanwhile, in 2023, Varda Space Industries, an e-commerce company aiming to establish in-space factories, will launch its first spacecraft aboard a Falcon 9 rocket. During its flight, the spacecraft will test space manufacturing technologies for up to three months. Then, it is expected that the re-entry capsule will return to earth between 40 and 60 kilograms of materials collected in orbit. Meanwhile, Varda executives said that SpaceX offered the best alternative for getting their mission into orbit based on price and reliability. Furthermore, the start-up company's financial strength is driven in part by launch costs, according to Delian Asparouhov, co-founder and president of Varda Space. Perhaps that explains their choice to use the least expensive solution. Similarly, according to Asparouhov, they are delighted that Varda signed up with SpaceX as its launch provider and that they are excited about this new deal. And Varda will finally be able to harness the tremendous benefits of microgravity manufacturing to benefit so many people on Earth whose lives will be radically changed as a result of the massive reduction in entry barriers. <br /><br /><br />üì∫ Watch the entire video for more information!<br /><br />_________________________________________________________________<br /><br />About Elon Musk
