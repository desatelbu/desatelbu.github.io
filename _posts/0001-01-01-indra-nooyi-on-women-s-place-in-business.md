{% raw %}Work and life is not a balancing act, it's a juggling act, says Indra Nooyi. For 12 years she was the CEO of PepsiCo – one of the few female leaders of a Fortune 500 company. Nooyi talks with correspondent Mola Lenghi about her memoir, &quot;My Life in Full: Work, Family, and Our Future,&quot; and about her mission of gender equity, which she insists is just good business.<br /><br />&quot;CBS Sunday Morning&quot; features stories on the arts, music, nature, entertainment, sports, history, science and Americana, and highlights unique human accomplishments and achievements.
