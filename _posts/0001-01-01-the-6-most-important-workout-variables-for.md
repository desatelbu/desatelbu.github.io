While this content can be helpful, we want to get straight to what works at a high level that the current body of research has also substantiated.<br /><br />This video will look at the six most important training variables for muscle growth based on a 2021 position stand of leading experts in the field. This paper's authors include well-established scientists and high-level coaches who have summarized the current research to provide guidelines for maximizing skeletal muscle hypertrophy.<br /><br />So if you're ready to optimize your training based on the latest science and what has worked in the field with pro-level bodybuilders, then stay tuned.<br /><br />[FREE BOOK] CLAIM YOUR FREE COPY OF BULK UP FAST! <br />➜ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bulkupbook.com/bulk-up-fast-sales-letter-a">https://www.bulkupbook.com/bulk-up-fast-sales-letter-a</a><br /><br /><br />[SUPPLEMENTS] SCIENCE-BASED SUPPLEMENTS THAT WORK! <br />➜ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://musclemonsters.com/pages/supplements">https://musclemonsters.com/pages/supplements</a><br /><br />[MASS-5 FULL BODY] HIGH FREQUENCY FULL BODY WORKOUT <br />➜ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://musclemonsters.com/collections/training-1/products/mass-5-body-workout">https://musclemonsters.com/collections/training-1/products/mass-5-body-workout</a><br /><br />[SHREDDED-12] SCIENCE-BASED FAT LOSS PROGRAM <br />➜ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://musclemonsters.com/products/shredded-12-fat-loss">https://musclemonsters.com/products/shredded-12-fat-loss</a><br /><br />FOLLOW US ON INSTAGRAM: <br />➜ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/musclemonsters">http://www.instagram.com/musclemonsters</a> <br /><br />Reference:<br />Schoenfeld, B., Fisher, J., Grgic, J., Haun, C., Helms, E., Phillips, S., Steele, J., &amp; Vigotsky, A.
