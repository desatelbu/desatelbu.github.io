Enjoy!<br /><br />C-3PO, often referred to as Threepio, was a 3PO-series protocol droid designed to interact with organics, programmed primarily for proper behavior and protocol. He was fluent in over six million forms of communication and developed a fussy and worry-prone personality throughout his many decades of operation. Along with his counterpart, the astromech droid R2-D2, C-3PO constantly found himself directly involved in pivotal moments of galactic history and aided in saving the galaxy on many occasions.<br /><br />C-3PO was rebuilt from spare parts by Anakin Skywalker.  Shortly after the Clone Wars, C-3PO's memory was erased, though R2-D2's memory was not. <br /><br />They became embroiled in the Galactic Civil War when Leia Organa of the Rebel Alliance entrusted them to bring a copy of the Death Star plans to the Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi on Tatooine.{% endraw %}
