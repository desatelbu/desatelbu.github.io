{% raw %}They assume that because they <br />have failed an IVF cycle in one <br />clinic, there's really no point in <br />going to a second clinic, <br />because they believe that all <br />clinics are the same.<br /> <br />After all, if the first clinic they've gone<br />to is not being able to achieve success,<br />then why will a new clinic be <br />able to do a better job?<br />After all, when they chose the first clinic , <br />they did a lot of homework, <br />checked references, and made sure <br />that their doctor was a good doctor.<br />They were happy with the treatment <br />they received ; they like their doctor; <br />and were treated with respect. <br /> <br />If the cycle still failed inspite of the <br />fact that their doctor was good, <br />then they assume that's because of bad luck , <br />and there's nothing much any one can do about it.<br /> <br />This is why they are happier sticking to the same clinic, <br />because they now have a relationship with the doctor.<br /> <br />However, this is often a mistake , <br />because the reality is that not all IVF <br />clinics are created the same , <br />and it does make a big difference <br />which clinic you select !<br /> <br />This is why patients need to understand <br />the difference between a <br />good and a bad clinic , <br />and just going to a doctor <br />who has a good bedside <br />manner is not enough !<br /> <br />The good news is that it's very easy <br />to differentiate between <br />good clinics and bad clinics !<br /> <br />Good clinics will always <br />routinely give embryo photos <br />to all their patients. <br />If your clinic fails to do so, this is a red flag, <br />and means you should get a <br />second opinion as soon as possible !<br /> <br />What to find an IVF clinic which <br />respects your time and intelligence ?<br />WhatsApp us at the below mentioned website <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://wa.me/919867441589/">https://wa.me/919867441589/</a>{% endraw %}
