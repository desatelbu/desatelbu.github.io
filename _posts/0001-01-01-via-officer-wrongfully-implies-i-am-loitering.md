He comes up saying I can't be here unless I am catching a bus.  I already explained I have permission to be here filming.  <br />  I could have been nicer but fuck him. <br />When these tyrants don't follow federal guidelines but try to say you are loitering they get what they get. <br />  Great timing my bus showed up 1 minute early.  <br />Had it not shown up he would say I was lying etc etc.    idiot why do you think I told you to look at the sign?  you immediately say I have been here a while.   yes officer because busses run on schedules people have to wait for them.<br />  kick rocks tyrant.<br />  wonder why auditors hate tyrants like him at via? <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/Ce1WQlgRP3I">https://youtu.be/Ce1WQlgRP3I</a><br />like and subscribe to sa210copwatch.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/6YyIWElrePA">https://youtu.be/6YyIWElrePA</a><br />truth be told audits{% endraw %}
