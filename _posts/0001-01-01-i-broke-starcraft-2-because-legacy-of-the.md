{% raw %}I started uploading this video over ten thousand years ago. Before YouTube was even invented. Wolly Mammoths helped edit it. YouTube's upload speed is so slow that it only has reached you today.<br /><br />I put myself in cryofreeze to arrive at this moment, but I am afraid I may have been too early. The video is only 68% uploaded and that isn't nice. At this rate humanity will collapse before I release this.<br /><br />Update: Six years have passed. It is now at 73%.<br /><br />Update 2: Fourty-Seven more years have passed. The video is at 90%. People no longer watch videos via YouTube and instead have advertisements beamed directly into their brains without any attached entertainment.<br /><br />Update 3: The Upload has finished. Skyrim has been re-released 142,816 times on every platform known to man while I waited. You can now use your microwave to be the Dovahkiin. Overwatch 2 has still not released.<br /><br />Update 4: This took so long, I sat in this box for hours, and somehow it never occurred to me to use this time to timestamp stuff. I am a good YouTuber.<br /><br />Update 5: I didn't include the Epilogue because it's boring. If you would like to know how it goes: The answer is Time Stop OP, Kerrigan OP, Kerrigan OP. She sure is balanced.<br /><br />You can support me here! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/GiantGrantGames">https://www.patreon.com/GiantGrantGames</a><br />I also stream 5 days per week: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/GiantGrantGames">https://www.twitch.tv/GiantGrantGames</a><br />Second channel for Daily Content: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfgBlFSyf80Fda3wPbK5vNQ/videos">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfgBlFSyf80Fda3wPbK5vNQ/videos</a><br /><br />0:00 - Dark Whispers<br />2:02 - Ghosts in the Fog<br />3:37 - For Aiur!<br />3:46 - The Growing Shadow<br />4:06 - The Halberd of Adun<br />5:15 - SkyShield<br />7:54 - Brothers With Arms<br />9:08 - Forbidden Weapon<br />9:30 - Amon's Reach<br />10:24 - Last Stand<br />14:36 - Temple of Unification<br />15:53 - Harbinger of Oblivion<br />16:51 - Unsealing the Past<br />18:44 - Purification<br />20:58 - Steps of the Rite<br />22:47 - Rak'Shir<br />24:53 - Templar's Charge<br />25:50 - Templar's Return<br />26:07 - The Host<br />29:24 - Salvation{% endraw %}
