It is better if prepared a day in advance. Those who drink it every day should leave a small amount as flavouring for those who prepare it the next day. Instead of an egg yolk one can add a beaten egg white after having removed the top layer of froth. Mix in a small amount of chocolate from the cafetiere then add to the cafetiere and finish as with the egg yolk.‚Äù<br /><br />Escape to the chateau with ‚ÄôThe Chateau Diaries‚Äô üè∞<br />This channel follows the adventures of chatelaine Stephanie in her French 16th century home, the Chateau de Lalande, in the heart of rural France ‚ù§Ô∏è <br />We share our life in this ancient chateau in the heart of the French countryside, and show you the diy, renovations, crafts, cooking and gardening that are needed to bring a home like this to life!<br /><br />A very special thank you to all of you who have become Patrons of the Chateau de Lalande.
