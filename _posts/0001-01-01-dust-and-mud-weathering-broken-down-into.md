{% raw %}My friends, armor weathering is very straightforward for the most part, but things always get very unpredictable when it comes to earth effects. For me, it's the part when I become uncertain about the final result and honestly, quite nervous! So I figured it would be useful to break the process down into a few easy to follow steps.<br /><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/nightshiftmodeller">https://www.patreon.com/nightshiftmodeller</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/nightshiftscalemodeller/">https://www.instagram.com/nightshiftscalemodeller/</a><br /><br />Enjoying this type of content?

I received a lot of them a long time ago, even before I started this channel. VMS is also one of my Patreon supporters. Being independent from big and exclusive sponsorship deals and showing you a wide variety of different brands and products was one of the founding ideas of this channel and I will always stand by this. <br /><br />Music: Quincas Moreira - Scratch the Itch - Youtube Audio Library{% endraw %}
