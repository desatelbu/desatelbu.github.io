{% raw %}For today I will be showing you the process I did for restoring this PS3 to it's former glory! It's been running like a champ since i've gotten it back and i'm really happy with how this PS3 has turned out. Definitely worth the $250ish in total that I paid for this console. Hope you enjoyed and don't forget to comment your thoughts down below!
