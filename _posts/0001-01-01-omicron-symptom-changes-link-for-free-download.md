/><br />Preliminary laboratory studies demonstrate that three doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine neutralize the Omicron variant (B.1.1.529 lineage),<br /><br />while two doses show significantly reduced neutralization titers<br /><br />Data indicate that a third dose of BNT162b2 increases the neutralizing antibody titers by 25-fold compared to two doses against the Omicron variant;<br /> <br />titers after the booster dose are comparable to titers observed after two doses against the wild-type virus which are associated with high levels of protection<br /><br />As 80% of epitopes in the spike protein recognized by CD8+ T cells are not affected by the mutations in the Omicron variant, two doses may still induce protection against severe disease<br /><br />The companies continue to advance the development of a variant-specific vaccine for Omicron and expect to have it available by March<br /><br />in the event that an adaption is needed to further increase the level and duration of protection – with no change expected to the companies’ four billion dose capacity for 2022{% endraw %}
