{% raw %}Welcome To AskReddit Is Fun <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyO5LhbJlmBXqEPSxKascsA?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyO5LhbJlmBXqEPSxKascsA?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />â–¶ Fresh AskReddit Stories: A man once told me if you want a good story just ask any random person if there was ever an event in their life they can not explain. Someone almost always has one weird thing that has happened to them. So reddit, regardless of whatever you belief about the world, do you have a story as such?{% endraw %}
