{% raw %}During the Second World War, a puppet state was installed by the Axis powers. The Ustasha were Croatian fascists who attempted to rid the region of Serbs, Jews and Roma. Whilst similar genocides were been committed by the Axis powers at the time, the level of barbarity and violence would be such as to raise concerns by their Nazi allies. Much of the horrors were carried out by way of tools and knives.{% endraw %}
