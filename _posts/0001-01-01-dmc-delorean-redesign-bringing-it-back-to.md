Painted DeLoreans do exist, although these were all painted after the cars were purchased from the factory.<br /><br />Another distinctive feature of the DeLorean is its gull-wing doors. The doors could only have small cutout windows since full-sized windows would not be fully retractable within the short door panels. <br /><br />When it comes to the power and drivetrain, the DeLorean was not really something to write home about. 0-60mph took around 9.5-10 seconds while the competitors of the time averaged around 7.5 seconds for the same sprint. <br /><br />When you look at the power output, it makes sense since the DeLorean only generated 130hp and 153 lb-ft of torque from its 2.8L V6.<br /><br />You could get your DeLorean with either a 5 speed manual or a 3 speed automatic.<br /><br />★My second channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/bembli">https://www.youtube.com/bembli</a><br />★My sketch course: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://analogdesignerpropack.com">https://analogdesignerpropack.com</a><br />★MERCH Hats, Tees &amp; More: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thesketchmonkey.com">https://thesketchmonkey.com</a><br />★Get exclusive content on my Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/thesketchmonkey">https://www.patreon.com/thesketchmonkey</a><br />★The books, art supplies and equipment I use: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/thesketchmonkey">https://www.amazon.com/shop/thesketchmonkey</a><br /><br />Thanks for watching!
