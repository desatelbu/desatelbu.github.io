{% raw %}This is a re-post of my previous Buried Secrets + Replicate video to fix up a couple of mistakes that were bugging me. The old one will be unlisted, and you can find it here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReluzKcfwTY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReluzKcfwTY</a><br /><br />This was mixed together using files extracted from the PC version of Destiny 2. The soundtrack was composed by Michael Salvatori, Skye Lewin, Josh Mosser (who wrote these tracks), Michael Sechrist, and Rotem Moav.<br /><br />So yeah, I don't re-post often but I had a couple of things I wasn't completely happy with in the previous version. I figured out after the fact that there was an ending file I had overlooked for Buried Secrets and it helped me find a much better point to transition it into Replicate's Phase 1. If you find you preferred the old transition more, you can still access the original upload at the link above.<br /><br />And about five days later I just spotted an error with this video, but not in the audio portion. It's easy to spot, but I'm not re-uploading this again. Hope no one minds.{% endraw %}
