Mix until it forms a dough. <br />Cover and refrigerate for a few hours or overnight.<br />Work the chilled dough by kneading a few times. Place the dough between two silicone mats. Roll the dough out into a rectangle, 2mm thick. Make the rectangle a little over 12 cm (5 in) wide. The length does not matter.<br />Remove the top silicone mat. Use a pastry wheel to cut the dough into 2.5 cm (1 in) strips. <br />Keep frozen until ready to use. You can place frozen craquelin dough directly onto unbaked eclairs. <br /><br />If at any time, the dough becomes too soft, sticky or starts to break easily, put the dough back in the refrigerator until it firms up. <br /><br />My eclair template <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.desperatelydesserts.com/eclairs-my-attempt-to-make-perfect-shells/">https://www.desperatelydesserts.com/eclairs-my-attempt-to-make-perfect-shells/</a><br />My blog <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.desperatelydesserts.com">https://www.desperatelydesserts.com</a> <br />My Facebook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/dessertsbyjasminek">https://www.facebook.com/dessertsbyjasminek</a> <br />My Instagram <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/dessertsbydesign.ck">https://www.instagram.com/dessertsbydesign.ck</a>{% endraw %}
