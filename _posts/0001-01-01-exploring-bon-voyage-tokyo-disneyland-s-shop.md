{% raw %}In August 2019 we explored Bon Voyage which is next to Tokyo Disneyland just outside of Maihama Station. It is considered Tokyo Disneyland's shop of shops as it encompasses souvenirs from both Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea. You'll find most of the souvenirs from the parks including character hats, Mickey ear headbands, sweet treats, pillows, clothes and more at Bon Voyage.  <br /><br />Here's a link to the Bon Voyage website.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tokyodisneyresort.jp/en/tdr/facility/bv.html">https://www.tokyodisneyresort.jp/en/tdr/facility/bv.html</a><br /><br />Hope you enjoyed!
