{% raw %}Dave Rubin of The Rubin Report talks about the emerging details of the suspect in the Waukesha Christmas parade SUV attack, anti-vax protests in Perth, Australia, the ever increasing number of COVID booster shots that may be required, and Ron DeSantis telling Ben Shapiro exactly how the right should handle the mainstream media. First, Dave goes into the details about the suspect in the Waukesha Christmas parade incident that you won’t be hearing on CNN or the mainstream media. Over the weekend a man drove his SUV through a Christmas parade in Wisconsin killing 5 people and injuring many others. The suspect, Darrell Edward Brooks, has a long history of supporting BLM messaging, and performing anti-Trump rap songs under the name MathBoi Fly, Will the media ignore all the details that go against their narratives? Next, Dave shares a clip from the anti-vaccine protests in Perth, Australia. Vaccine mandate backlash is now causing major protests in Europe and Australia. Why won’t American media cover it? Dave also shares a clip of Winsome Sears’ fiery response to being asked if she was vaccinated by a CNN host. How many COVID booster shots will Americans need to get? Dr. Fauci is unsure, but he has now admitted that it could be possible that a COVID 19 booster shot would be required every six months. Finally, Dave shares a clip from the Ben Shapiro Sunday Special of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis giving the blueprint for how Republicans need to deal with the media bias of the liberal media.<br /><br />----------<br /><br />Today’s Sponsors:<br />Chamonix's Genucel serum with plant stem cell technology helps get rid of those bags and puffiness under your eyes.
