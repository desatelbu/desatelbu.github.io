To each their own I guess!)<br />Juice from 1/2 or a full lemon (I LOVE lemon so I like to add a lot but you may want it a bit less tangy)<br /><br />First mix together the vital wheat gluten and water, this will form a dough quickly. Knead it a few times and then roll it into a thin tube shape and use scissors (so much easier than using a knife) to cut the dough into small pieces, like really small pieces (half an inch?) as the dough expands in the soup. It will be sticky which can be annoying but just cut them into little half inch pieces and place them onto a cutting board or plate.<br /><br />In a saucepan on medium heat saute the onions in oil till translucent, then add the celery, carrot, and garlic and cook for about five more minutes. Add the stock, &quot;chicken&quot; pieces (I usually pick up the little pieces and place them in quickly one by one because they are sticky; you can't really just scrape them off a cutting board with a knife), spices (including salt and pepper) and the rice. Bring to a boil and then reduce the heat and cover with a lid to simmer for 15 - 20 minutes until the rice is cooked.<br />Serve with lemon and parsley and hopefully feel nostalgic for childhood!<br /><br />00:00 Intro<br />00:22 Artist Katerina Vorónina<br />01:07 Korean Dakjuk<br />03:24 Trying Korean Dakjuk<br />05:30 Better Help Sponsorship<br />06:35 Jewish Matzah Ball Soup<br />08:56 Trying Matzah Ball Soup<br />10:46 Pepe Soup from Sierra Leone<br />13:15 Trying Pepe Soup from Sierra Leone<br />15:14 Vegan Chicken and Rice Soup from Canada<br />17:20 Trying Vegan Chicken and Rice Soup<br />19:39 Malaysian ABC Soup<br />22:14 Trying Malaysian ABC Soup<br />________________________________________<br /><br />Where I get my earrings with a little discount code! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shrsl.com/32k14">https://shrsl.com/32k14</a><br />Pops of Color aka the Microgreen kit I swear by: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shrsl.com/32k93">https://shrsl.com/32k93</a><br /><br />Here are Some Links for things you see often in my videos! <br />A VERY similar Glass Pot to the one I have: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/Z9V1jo">https://geni.us/Z9V1jo</a><br />My little red blender: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/DPIkH">https://geni.us/DPIkH</a><br />Bamboo Cutting Board: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/F0T2ZC">https://geni.us/F0T2ZC</a><br />Colorful Ceramic Bowls: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/EuAsnn">https://geni.us/EuAsnn</a><br />Mini Whisk That Is the Best Whisk: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/sNA9H7c">https://geni.us/sNA9H7c</a><br />Silicone Brush: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/P9TDJ">https://geni.us/P9TDJ</a><br />Small Silicone Spatulas that I Love: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/qBgs">https://geni.us/qBgs</a><br />Wooden Spoons: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/0N17A">https://geni.us/0N17A</a><br /><br />My Favorite Board Games Right Now<br />Dominion: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/4HlP">https://geni.us/4HlP</a><br />Ticket to Ride: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/fAcAcJ">https://geni.us/fAcAcJ</a><br />Carcassonne: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/p4Ldfr">https://geni.us/p4Ldfr</a><br />7 Wonders: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/TgSw">https://geni.us/TgSw</a><br /><br />Wanna mail something?<br />Beryl Shereshewsky<br />115 East 34th Street FRNT 1<br />PO Box 1742<br />New York, NY 10156<br /><br />Follow me on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/shereshe/">https://www.instagram.com/shereshe/</a><br />Support me on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/beryl">https://www.patreon.com/beryl</a>{% endraw %}
