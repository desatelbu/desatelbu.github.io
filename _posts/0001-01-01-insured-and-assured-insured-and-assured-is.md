{% raw %}Insured and Assured is one of the 30 poems in the book *Infinite Profit and Meaning to Life* written by Mudenda Brian. <br />It looks objectively at how investing in material wealth,or whatever is earthly bound avails little and surely is nothing. <br />We may invest and insure here but if we haven't insured with heaven both our wealth and bodies will turn into beautiful ashes when the one and only owner of earth comes to claim His own. Hence only those who invest heavenward are assured for wether they'll be dead or alive they'll surely appear and seize for themselves that which they would have invested in heaven. Will you not invest in your character now,which the only thing that will qualify you? Won't you form a character fit for translation/first resurrection? Insure now with Christ coz all who do so are Assured. He has no shadow of turning. James 1:17; Hebrews 13:8<br /> For a free pdf copy of the  whole book that looks at meaning to life send *meaning to life* to the email address below: <br />brianmmudenda@gmail.com{% endraw %}
