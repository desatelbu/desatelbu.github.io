{% raw %}It's a mistake to link a more aggressive Federal Reserve with lower gold prices, said Christopher Ecclestone, principal and mining strategist at Hallgarten &amp; Co, told Michelle Makori, lead anchor and Editor-in-Chief of Kitco News, on the sidelines of the Mines and Money London conference. <br /><br />&quot;Traditionally, gold has been a hedge against inflation. There is a mistaken view that higher interest rates would impact the price of gold because supposedly people are borrowing money to buy gold which is totally a bogus construct,&quot; Ecclestone said. &quot;Most people are using gold as a savings method.&quot;<br /><br />They also talked about how inflation impacts the price of gold. Hallgarten produces research on the natural resources sector.<br /><br />Follow Michelle Makori on Twitter: @MichelleMakori (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/MichelleMakori)">https://twitter.com/MichelleMakori)</a><br />__________________________________________________________________<br />Kitco News is the world’s #1 source of metals market information.
