{% raw %}This activity has been designed for students that are learning at home (online) and do not have specific lab equipment typically used in a classroom environment.  <br /><br />The video goes through an experiment (investigation) where the specific heat capacity for two different metals (zinc, brass) can be measured.  The initial temperature of the metal is recorded, and after being placed in a cup of water, the final temperature of the metal is recorded.  Heat energy from the metal is transferred to the water, cooling the metal while warming the water, until thermal equilibrium occurs.<br /><br />A measurement of the mass of the metal along with the mass of the water is illustrated, and the specific heat capacity for the different metals can be calculated.  Tables are included to help organize with the calculations.<br /><br />This experiment is usually done in a first year physics class in high school (secondary school), or a grade 11 physics class, when thermal energy processes.<br /><br />This video is also ideal for students in an IB physics SL HL program or AP physics program that are studying at home.{% endraw %}
