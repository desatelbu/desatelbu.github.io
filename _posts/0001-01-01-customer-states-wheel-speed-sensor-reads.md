{% raw %}Customer stated that there are multiple warning lights on (Christmas tree) We do a full scan of the vehicle and read a DTC for the left rear wheel speed sensor. When we did real time data logger we could not believe what that sensor was reading at! We find the issue, WE FOUND RODENT DAMAGE IN THE INTERIOR OF THE VEHICLE. Enjoy{% endraw %}
