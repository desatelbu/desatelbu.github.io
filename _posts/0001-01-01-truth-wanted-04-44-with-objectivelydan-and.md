Truth Wanted would like to know how you know itâ€™s true. Hosted by ObjectivelyDan, Truth Wanted takes calls from the community (that means YOU!) and features new guests every week, emphasizing thorough conversations over name-calling and scoffing (most of the time). Truth Wanted focuses on how and why people believe what they believe, and how you can talk about beliefs in more effective ways. Join us for truth investigations and lively conversations every Friday at 7:00pm CT! <br /><br />The Atheist Community of Austin is organized as a nonprofit educational corporation to develop and support the atheist community, to provide opportunities for socializing and friendship, to promote secular viewpoints, to encourage positive atheist culture, to defend the first amendment principle of state-church separation, to oppose discrimination against atheists and to work with other organizations in pursuit of common goals.<br /><br />We define atheism as the lack of belief in gods. This definition also encompasses what most people call agnosticism.<br /><br />â–º <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.atheist-community.org">http://www.atheist-community.org</a> (The Atheist Community of Austin)<br />â–º Check out Dan's other channel @ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/objectivelydan">https://www.youtube.com/objectivelydan</a><br /><br />NOTES<br /><br />TruthWanted is the official channel of Truth Wanted. &quot;Truth Wanted&quot; is a trademark of the ACA.<br /><br />Thumbnail artwork by: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/princepsed">https://www.instagram.com/princepsed</a> <br /><br />Copyright Â© 2018-2021 Atheist Community of Austin.
