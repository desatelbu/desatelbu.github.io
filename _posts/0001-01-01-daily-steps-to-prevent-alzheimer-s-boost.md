It’s time to get empowered instead. There are so many simple steps we can take every single day to strengthen our brains and reduce the risk for Alzheimer’s. Considering that this disease starts in the brain 20 to 30 years before the first signs of memory loss, we should all be thinking about prevention. Today, I’m so excited to finally welcome Dr. Richard Isaacson onto The Doctor’s Farmacy to talk about taking care of the brain in a whole new way. <br /><br />Dr. Richard Isaacson serves as Director of the Center for Brain Health and Director of the Alzheimer’s Prevention Clinic (APC) at Florida Atlantic University’s Schmidt College of Medicine. He previously served as Director of the APC at the Weill Cornell Memory Disorders Program, Assistant Dean of Faculty Development, and Associate Professor of Neurology at Weill Cornell Medicine &amp; NewYork-Presbyterian. He remains as Adjunct Associate Professor of Neurology in the Department of Neurology at Weill Cornell. Prior to that, he served as Associate Professor of Clinical Neurology, Vice-Chair of Education, and Education Director of the McKnight Brain Institute in the Department of Neurology at the University of Miami (UM) Miller School of Medicine. Prior to joining UM, he served as Associate Medical Director of the Wien Center for Alzheimer’s disease and Memory Disorders at Mount Sinai.<br /><br />This episode is brought to you by Essentia, BiOptimizers, and Joovv.<br /><br />It’s the perfect time to try Essentia, since they’re having their biggest Black Friday sale of the year.
