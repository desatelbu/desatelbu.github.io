You'd make a KILLING. <br /><br />Unfortunately, We can't do that, so we have to try and take an educated guess of what our future will look like, and invest for the long term.<br /><br />PART 2: THE METAVERSE<br /><br />Think of the metaverse like Internet 2.0, even more, immersive and useful. You could hang out with friends, work remotely from home but feel like you're in the office and even sell digital items, all in Virtual Reality.<br /><br />This opens up more opportunities than even I can't fathom, Because not just one company will benefit from the metaverse. This means you don't have to be lucky and yolo your money into a winning stock.<br /><br />Instead, it's a much better idea to build a diversified portfolio of companies with metaverse plans. This way you are hedging your bets and at the end of the day, they could all end up being crucial parts of the metaverse! <br /><br />PART 3: My Metaverse Stocks<br /><br />Stock Number 1 is Unity Software.<br /><br />Something that recently caught my eye was that Unity Software have recently aquired Weta Digital. The future of the Metaverse is 3D experiences and that's what WETA excels at. This combined with Unity's already great software, and they could have the perfect building blocks for the metaverse.<br /><br />Stock number 2 is Snapchat.<br /><br />Some analysts even claim Snapchat is way ahead of Facebook when it comes to the Metaverse, as they have already created characters and plonked them on the map for everyone to see and interact with. Just think about it, the best features usually first come out on Snapchat, and then get copied by Instagram! <br /><br />Stock Number 3 is Matterport<br /><br />This is a company you may not have heard of, but they specialize in digitizing the real world. Imagine how in demand this technology could be if you want to create a digital version of your house inside the metaverse and invite your friends over!<br /><br />During my research, I uncovered that If matterport were to charge just $1 to maintain a digital copy of a customer's space each month, the company could be able to make more than $280 billion annually.<br /><br />Stock Number 4 Is Disney.<br /><br />Disney owns most of the entertainment we watch! Like Star Wars, Marvel studios &amp; Pixar Films...that combined with Disney World, Disney Land and their cruise ships.. you can probably see what I'm getting at here.<br /><br />Disney could create a full blown Disney Land Metaverse, with all the characters and movies they own... it would be absolutely amazing.<br /><br />Stock Number 5 is Meta (Previously known as Facebook)<br /><br />The possibilities of monetizing the Metaverse are endless for Meta, and I'm so excited to see what they do next. They also have the Oculus VR headsets which make the Metaverse all that more plausible, and they're already working on new stylish glasses for use of both AR and VR.<br /><br />Stock Number 5.5 is Epic Games<br /><br />They're the creators of Fortnite and kids basically lived on this game during the pandemic! It has even had in game events such as a virtual concert by Travis Scott which was attended by over 12 MILLION! <br />________________________________________________<br />CONTACT:<br />For business inquires only, please use this email: mark@marktilburycoaching.com<br /><br />*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Mark Tilbury will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.
