{% raw %}Alcohol ink technique - tutorial.<br />Alcohol ink fades and wispy is a technique that a lot of people love, including me. When I was new I spend a lot of time trying to learn this and over the years I have found many different ways of achieving this look.<br /><br />One of my absolute favorite techniques is tilting. So much fun to do.<br />It was tricky at first, but with a little practice I started getting better and better at it, and now I can't stop the tilting.... <br /><br />It is so fascinating to watch that ink and brass just float around with the alcohol.<br />If you haven't tried this yet... I hope you will.<br /><br />I made this piece on Nara paper with Ranger Amethyst and Piñata brass.<br /><br />Hope you enjoy the video and thank you so much for watching.<br /><br />As always, here are some affiliated links for Amazon for some of the things I used in the video and some of my other favorite products :<br /><br />PME airbrush - blows constantly <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3bAT7QP">https://amzn.to/3bAT7QP</a><br /><br />Pro airbrush (I haven’t tried this one but heard it was good)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3Fbem8A">https://amzn.to/3Fbem8A</a><br /><br />Posca pens - white<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3GPTUM6">https://amzn.to/3GPTUM6</a><br /><br />Ring light (I use this when painting and filming for YT)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3DOry2A">https://amzn.to/3DOry2A</a><br /><br />Piñata brass:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3Ac8w4e">https://amzn.to/3Ac8w4e</a><br /><br />Tim Holtz alcohol ink 24 bottle mega set:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2YtGIeL">https://amzn.to/2YtGIeL</a><br /><br />Nara paper - 12&quot;x9&quot;:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3yI3MTC">https://amzn.to/3yI3MTC</a><br /><br />Nara paper - big roll:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3k6mlfZ">https://amzn.to/3k6mlfZ</a><br /><br />Copic varius ink refills - cotton pearl<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3xI3pYM">https://amzn.to/3xI3pYM</a><br /><br />Ranger alcohol ink 3 pack, blue colors:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3hSa6Ru">https://amzn.to/3hSa6Ru</a><br /><br />Ranger alcohol ink 3 pack, pink/red:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3xuzIKM">https://amzn.to/3xuzIKM</a><br /><br />Tim Holtz air blower:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2SZoLSu">https://amzn.to/2SZoLSu</a><br /><br />Hairdryer that is very similar to mine - just a different brand<br />Revlon hairdryer:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3r6C547">https://amzn.to/3r6C547</a><br /><br />Fine line applicators - 3 pack for alcohol/metallics:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3wuf5gB">https://amzn.to/3wuf5gB</a><br /><br />**** These are affiliated links - this means that I get a very small percentage of purchases made using the links.
