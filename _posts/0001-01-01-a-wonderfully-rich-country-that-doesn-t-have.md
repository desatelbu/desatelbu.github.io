{% raw %}Today, we will tell you about a very rich and wonderful country. It doesn't have its own currency, language, or airport. Its roads are only 155 miles long. The country looks like it was made by elves and the locals are as rich as gnomes. This country is so small you can walk around it in a day and can only reach it by bus. This tiny country is just 12.5 miles long and 3.7 miles wide. It has very low taxes and no national debt. You won't believe it, but you can rent this country. <br />#Pandora US#{% endraw %}
