What makes these ''caught on camera'' moments so scary is the fact that they were filmed in places like africa, india, safaris, national parks and other parts of Asia.<br /><br />Some of these clips feature clips where tourists get chased and attacked by a tiger, tourists in a car in India get approached by tigers, bikers almost get attacked by a tiger, men in Nepal have a tiger encounter, tourists in India get very close to a tiger and men in India fight off a tiger.<br /><br />Some of these creepy videos even feature moments where people were chased down by these animals, which are known to attack or stalk people who are out camping, hunting or hiking or just exploring the safari.<br /><br />These tiger vs man moments are sure to give you the chills and the fact that some people were lucky enough to capture these near death experiences on gopros ou on tape makes it even crazier.<br /><br />DISCLAIMER: All materials in these videos are used for entertainment purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
