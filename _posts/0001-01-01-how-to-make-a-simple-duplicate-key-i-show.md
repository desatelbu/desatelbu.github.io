{% raw %}I show how to make a simple duplicate key that can be made from a plastic card, a tin can or any other similar material. This can be used as an emergency spare key. The first step is to use a lighter and clear tape to make an outline of the key with the exact dimensions of the original. The outline of the key is on the clear tape which can be transferred to a plastic card or the lid of a tin can. The key is then cut out as precise as possible and can be used to open the lock. It may be too flimsy to turn so you can use a small flathead screwdriver or a lockpicking tension wrench to turn the key. <br /><br />If you enjoy the channel, please support Von Malegowski:<br />- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.me/VonMalegowski">https://www.paypal.me/VonMalegowski</a><br /><br />Lock Picking Tools: <br />- Lockpick Gun: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/31e63pH">https://amzn.to/31e63pH</a><br />- Electronic Lockpick Gun: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2EYHP99">https://amzn.to/2EYHP99</a><br />- Clear Lock: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/31gCaF8">https://amzn.to/31gCaF8</a><br />- Tubular Practice Lock: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2LSEYAP">https://amzn.to/2LSEYAP</a><br />- Practice Lock Set: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Ljh82Y">https://amzn.to/2Ljh82Y</a><br />- Lockpick set 1: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2IoP5My">https://amzn.to/2IoP5My</a><br />- Lockpick set 2: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2WpyYDo">https://amzn.to/2WpyYDo</a><br /><br />Connect With Me:<br />- Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/VonMalegowski">https://twitter.com/VonMalegowski</a><br />- Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/vonmalegowski/">https://www.instagram.com/vonmalegowski/</a><br />- Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/VonMalegowski2">https://www.facebook.com/VonMalegowski2</a><br /><br />On stiffer plastic, you may have to bend the key to make it fit into the keyway better. It is very easy to make a duplicate key this way and can be done in a few minutes. Be careful to make the teeth of the key as accurate as possible so it does not get stuck in the keyway.  <br /><br />More Lockpicking Videos:<br />ðŸ”“How to Pick a Lock (Basics)ðŸ”“: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/mO3mMYwKkKs">https://youtu.be/mO3mMYwKkKs</a><br />How to make a Lock Pick: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/SQKwoGbV3F4">https://youtu.be/SQKwoGbV3F4</a><br />How to Make a Simple Lock Shim: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/GBOvt2VH5B0">https://youtu.be/GBOvt2VH5B0</a><br /><br />Lockpicking is the art of unlocking a lock by analyzing and manipulating the components of the lock device without the original key. In addition, ideal lock picking should not damage the lock itself, allowing it to be rekeyed for later use, which is especially important with antique locks that would be impossible to replace if destructive entry methods were used. Although lock picking can be associated with criminal intent, it is an essential skill for a locksmith and is often pursued by law-abiding citizens as a useful skill to learn or simply a hobby. The move towards combination locks for high-security items such as safes was intended to remove the weakest part of the lock: its keyhole.<br /><br />Von Malegowski Equipment List: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/x5VtWv">https://goo.gl/x5VtWv</a><br />Von Malegowski Equipment List (Updated 2020): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2XCXAMH">https://bit.ly/2XCXAMH</a><br /><br />Music: YouTube Audio Library<br />Tracks: Dark_Red_Wine, Dont_Change_A_Thing, EDM_Detection_Mode <br />Artists: Silent Partner; Kevin MacLeod; Audionautix <br />Dark Red Wine by Audionautix is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)</a> Artist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://audionautix.com/">http://audionautix.com/</a><br /><br /><br />Â©Von Malegowski.
