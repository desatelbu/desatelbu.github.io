{% raw %}Bojana Bejatovic is a well-known personality in the world of chess. She is a fine chess player having represented Macedonia in several chess Olympiads. She also teaches chess. And she is on FIDE's Fairplay Commission. She also works for the Association of Chess Professionals (ACP) and is a board member as well as the social media manager. <br /><br />We speak extensively about the fairplay measures that FIDE is trying to implement especially in online play and whether she feels that online play can ever be rid of cheating. Bojana makes a very interesting point in her interview which is that the aim is not just to keep implementing the fairplay measures as a part of her committee's work but also to inculcate a spirit of fairplay among the youngsters in chess.<br /><br />Video: ChessBase India <br /><br />#Chess #ChessBaseIndia #CarlsenNepo<br />----------------------------------------------------------------<br />Subscribe to the ChessBase India Channel on YouTube for more informative and exciting videos!<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Subscribe to ChessBase India on YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ChessBaseIndiachannel">https://www.youtube.com/c/ChessBaseIndiachannel</a><br /><br />Subscribe to our second channel - ChessBase India clips for fun and exciting content:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjYrfY1-CCX2pagdnRrNUpA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjYrfY1-CCX2pagdnRrNUpA</a><br /><br />If you like content in Hindi, then do subscribe to Hindi ChessBase India channel:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ChessBaseIndiaHindi">https://www.youtube.com/c/ChessBaseIndiaHindi</a><br /><br />Check out chessbase.in for quality news and updates: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://chessbase.in">http://chessbase.in</a><br /><br />Find all latest ChessBase DVD, Quality Chess books and other accessories: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://chessbase.in/online-shop/">https://chessbase.in/online-shop/</a><br /><br />You may also buy from ChessBase India storefront in Amazon India: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2vv0XXy">https://amzn.to/2vv0XXy</a><br />------------------------------------<br /><br />ChessBase India on Social Media<br />------------------------------------<br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/ChessbaseIndia">https://twitter.com/ChessbaseIndia</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/chessbaseindia/">https://www.facebook.com/chessbaseindia/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/chessbaseindia">https://www.instagram.com/chessbaseindia</a> <br />---------------------------------------------<br /><br />In case of any questions feel free to reach out to our team at chessbaseindia@gmail.com{% endraw %}
