{% raw %}Grindelwald is one of our most favourite spots in Switzerland. We always try to spend few days around this area atleast once a year, usually during Summer. And I‘m always a fan of thrill walks specially this one here in First Mountain in Grindelwald, and my husband would rather avoid it. I‘m just glad he’ll always try his best with joining me. <br /><br />The First Cliff Walk is one of the must-see attractions of the Jungfrau Region in Berner Oberland. This elevated walkway is perched to the side of the mountain at over 2,000 m height. And is so awesome for people who are not afraid of heights, so cool  you’ll surely love the tip of the walk specially when the weather is nice and you can see the views around. And if you‘re afraid of heights - just don‘t look down. <br /><br />The walk is really incredible &amp; fun. And takes only around 10 minutes to complete it, depending of course on how fast you walk and how many people are there as it can get crowded at times. I just wish it wasn't so foggy during our visit but it was still a cool experience. Very thrilling! <br /><br />#Cliffwalk #first #swissalps #travelSwitzerland #Swissmountains #Grindelwald #Bern #Swissvlog{% endraw %}
