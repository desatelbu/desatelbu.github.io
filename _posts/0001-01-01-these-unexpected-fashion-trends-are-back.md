Some I thought would never reappear and others . . . well I'm SO pleased they're back. I also just wanted to say a heartfelt thank you for everyone who sent me such lovely kind and caring messages on my recent community tab post. I feel so incredibly lucky that I have so many amazing women from all over the world who took the time to reach out and send love. It was exactly what I needed so thank you. We've been locked down again in Auckland for almost two months and the feeling of being cut off from friends and family was really starting to get to me. I haven't been able to get home to Sydney to see family for over four years now (thanks to Covid) and I'm usually ok but being locked down seemed to throw me into a bit of a tailspin. But all of your loving messages really helped to life me out of the doldrums so thank you thank you thank you. <br />Anyway, once again thank you for watching today's episode and please let me know what you think about these comeback trends in the comments below.<br />Sending love.<br /><br />Leonie <br />x<br /><br />This episode is kindly sponsored by Skillshare.<br /><br />♡  YOU CAN BUY MY BOOK HERE ♡  <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://the-style-insider.creator-spring.com/listing/the-ultimate-style-guide">https://the-style-insider.creator-spring.com/listing/the-ultimate-style-guide</a><br /><br />♡  60 FASHION TIPS &amp; TRICKS EVERYONE SHOULD KNOW<br />MY FREE MINI E-BOOK ♡ <br />Download here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://landing.mailerlite.com/webforms/landing/w3m5p7">https://landing.mailerlite.com/webforms/landing/w3m5p7</a><br /><br /><br />♡  MORE VIDEOS ♡ <br /><br />Top 2021 Wearable Fashion Trends (Part 1)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMQt5JDPWpU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMQt5JDPWpU</a><br /><br />Top 2021 Wearable Fashion Trends (Part 2)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/pVH0ML-Tiww">https://youtu.be/pVH0ML-Tiww</a><br /><br />Are you a fashion Mess?
