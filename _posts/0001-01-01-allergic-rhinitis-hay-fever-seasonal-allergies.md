{% raw %}Allergic rhinitis (also known as Hay Fever) is a relatively common condition that involves inflammation of the nasal mucosa in response to allergens. These allergens can trigger release of inflammatory mediators (like histamine) from mast cells, and these mediators can lead to a variety of signs and symptoms.
