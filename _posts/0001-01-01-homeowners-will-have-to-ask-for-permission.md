Crime is through the roof and there is endless smash and grabs and very challenging regulations for businesses and landlords coupled with increased taxes. The world and the economy as a whole are going through a lot but no place on earth is going through more change that that of California.<br /><br />This new bill would force all property owners to disclose that they intend to sell their property and notify their tenants and then notify the state and non profits to see if they would like to buy their property, they then could list it on the open market but not before a cooling off period where the tenant, state or non profit could come in and acquire the property.<br /><br />All of these changes are changing California real estate and will likely make investors both old and new consider twice about allocating capital to California.{% endraw %}
