This structural component transfers loads from the landing gear into the rest of the airframe. It was made on a male mold using a manufacturing process called infusion. The mold for this part was a bit different than our standard molds. Normally we CNC cut a mold pattern from tooling board and then use the mold pattern to create a final mold. The trunnion frame mold was instead directly CNC cut from an assembly of MDF stock.  <br /><br />DarkAero 1 Aircraft - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.darkaero.com/aircraft">https://www.darkaero.com/aircraft</a><br />DarkAero Knowledge Base - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.darkaero.com/knowledge">https://www.darkaero.com/knowledge</a><br />DarkAero Apparel - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.darkaero.com/shop">https://www.darkaero.com/shop</a><br /><br />If you enjoyed this video and would like to see more of this type of content, follow along as we work to create the fastest, longest range aircraft you can build in your garage!<br /><br />More information on DarkAero can be found on our website and other social media accounts: <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.darkaero.com">https://www.darkaero.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/darkaeroinc">https://www.facebook.com/darkaeroinc</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/darkaeroinc">https://www.instagram.com/darkaeroinc</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/darkaero-inc">https://www.linkedin.com/company/darkaero-inc</a>{% endraw %}
