{% raw %}Call of Duty Vanguard Only You Can Prevent Friendly Casualties Trophy Guide / Achievement Guide - In Operation Tonga, throw smoke from the anti-tank ditch to provide cover for the charge [Bronze]<br /><br />Mission 2: Operation Tonga<br />Objective: Take the Bridgehead<br />Shortly after reuniting with your teammates at the burning windmill, after encountering the next group of enemies, you will enter a courtyard with a Half-track (armored vehicle with MG turret) and lots of enemies. At the start of this area, on the left side, is a case with smoke grenades. Pick them up from here and keep them with you throughout the mission. You'll need them later. The trophy itself doesn't take place here right away, but later in the mission.<br /><br />Keep playing until you must drive a truck down a hill to crash it into a minefield (Objective: Clear a way through the minefield). Right after this part, your army will run into a big ditch while being shot at by MG turrets from bunkers. Give the D-Pad Up order to charge the bunkers. Then, while at the ditch, press :l1: to throw the smoke grenades that you picked up earlier in the mission. This will unlock the trophy. Even though the trophy description calls it &quot;anti-tank ditch&quot;, there are actually no tanks here or anywhere in this mission, just the MGs in the bunkers shooting at the ditch.<br /><br />SUBSCRIBE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=powerpyx">https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=powerpyx</a><br /><br />Support this Channel by becoming a Member: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWBA1-H9A5IldSb3tNwQmtQ/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWBA1-H9A5IldSb3tNwQmtQ/join</a><br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Follow PowerPyx:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.powerpyx.com">https://www.powerpyx.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/PowerPyx">https://www.youtube.com/PowerPyx</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/PowerPyx">https://www.facebook.com/PowerPyx</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/PowerPyx">https://www.twitter.com/PowerPyx</a><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />____________________________________<br /><br />All Call of Duty Vanguard Trophies &amp; Achievements:<br /><br />The Birth Of Special Forces<br />Get all Trophies in Call of Duty: Vanguard<br /><br />Phoenix Extinguished<br />Beat Call of Duty: Vanguard's Campaign on any difficulty<br /><br />The Tip Of The Spear<br />Beat Call of Duty: Vanguard's Campaign on Veteran difficulty<br /><br />Did I Get 'em?<br />In Campaign, get 15 kills using Blind Fire<br /><br />Munition Magpie<br />In Campaign, scavenge ammo from 15 enemy corpses within 3 seconds of killing them<br /><br />Gotta Try Them All!<br />In Campaign, kill enemies with 15 different weapons throughout the game<br /><br />OH YEAH!<br />In Campaign, Tactical Sprint through 5 Destructible walls<br /><br />F<br />In Campaign, die by your own grenade's explosion<br /><br />Not Your Fairy Godmother<br />In Campaign, throw back 15 grenades that would have killed or damaged your allies<br /><br />Couldn't Have Done It Without You<br />Watch the credits to completion<br /><br />Shot Caller<br />As Arthur, give 15 different commands to your allies<br /><br />Pop Goes The Nightingale<br />As Polina, kill 15 enemies immediately after emerging from a crawlspace<br /><br />Heightened Senses<br />As Wade, kill 15 enemies using his focus ability<br /><br />Pocket Full Of Fun<br />As Lucas, use 4 types of lethal equipment, getting 3 kills with each<br /><br />Ticket Please<br />In Phoenix, kill 15 enemies while standing atop a train car roof<br /><br />Beware Of Trains<br />In Phoenix, shoot a truck driver with a vehicle full of soldiers<br /><br />Actions Speak Louder Than Words<br />In Operation Tonga, protect Evans with quick reflexes<br /><br />Only You Can Prevent Friendly Casualties<br />In Operation Tonga, throw smoke from the anti-tank ditch to provide cover for the charge<br /><br />Legend In The Making<br />In Stalingrad, protect the Partisans without missing a shot<br /><br />Rain Of Fire<br />In Stalingrad, hit a halftrack with a Molotov Cocktail<br /><br />Slow But Deadly<br />In The Battle of Midway, help 5 threatened Allies during a dogfight<br /><br />Duck And Dive<br />In The Battle of Midway, avoid getting hit by bullets during the first Dive-Bomb<br /><br />Untouchable<br />In Numa Numa Trail, avoid getting hit by the sniper<br /><br />Survivalist<br />In Numa Numa Trail, find Mateo without firing a bullet<br /><br />Bird Of Prey<br />In Lady Nightingale, kill 5 snipers across the open field without getting hit by them<br /><br />Behind You<br />In Lady Nightingale, take out all of Steiner's troops in the department store using only takedowns<br /><br />That's Definitely Not A Knife<br />In the Rats of Tobruk, bring down the Stuka with a pistol, grenade, or rocket<br /><br />Pied Piper<br />In The Rats of Tobruk, lead the Rats through the desert without getting detected<br /><br />Leaving An Impression<br />In the battle of El Alamein, get run over by a tank<br /><br />She'll Be Right Mate<br />In the battle of El Alamein, get twice as many kills as Des during the final defend<br /><br />Allies Together, Strong<br />In The Fourth Reich, use Leadership to help takedown a Jäger Mörder<br /><br />Order In Chaos<br />In The Fourth Reich, go through the level without any instances of friendly fire<br /><br />Leet Skills<br />Reach level 55 in Multiplayer<br /><br />Top Of The Mountain<br />Reach max level with an operator in Multiplayer (base game operators only)<br /><br />Bling Pro 2.0<br />Reach max level with a weapon (base game weapons only)<br /><br />Hello There<br />Join a clan in Multiplayer{% endraw %}
