{% raw %}In his address to the IIEA, Professor Michael Ignatieff explores the reasons behind the rise of illiberal democracy in Eastern Europe and why universities are among the targets of these illiberal regimes. He notes that the move of the Central European University from Budapest to Vienna marked a low point for free speech and civil society in Hungary and is part of a wider challenge to liberal democracy which appears to be on the ascent throughout the European Union. From his experience as Rector of the Central European University, and as a noted commentator on illiberalism, Michael Ignatieff discusses the role of history in fuelling illiberalism in Eastern Europe and the importance of facing the truth about the past in order to overcome the challenges of today.<br /><br />About the Speaker:<br /><br />Michael Ignatieff is a Canadian writer, historian and former politician, former Rector of Central European University in Budapest and Vienna, and now professor of history there. He is the author of many books including his latest On Consolation: Finding Solace in Dark Times.<br /><br />Recorded on the 8th of December 2021{% endraw %}
