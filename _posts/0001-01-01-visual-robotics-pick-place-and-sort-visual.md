{% raw %}Visual Robotic Systems, Inc.          www.VisualRobotics.com<br /><br />Visual Robotics' VIM-201 vision system provides unprecedented 3D capabilities for visual robotic guidance at a reasonable price.  This video provides background on the product and market positioning, and several live demonstrations showing pick and place off of varying heights, sorting by size, and other examples of its power.<br /><br />While nominally a 2D camera, the VIM-201 is 3D positionally aware at all times.  This eliminates the infamous stop-take a picture-restart problem inherent in competitive offerings from Robotiq and others.  Instead, without using a force sensor the VIM-201 can quickly pick the top box off of a stack until no boxes are left.<br /><br />You'll also see the robot sort randomly placed boxes into different stacks according to their size.  It does this as fast or faster than many 3D systems, including Pickit3D, Zivid, and Phontoneo, yet it doesn't need monster processing to do it.  <br /><br />With our Vision-in-Motion technology we aren't afraid of motion, we thrive on it.  This means the item to be picked not only doesn't have to be in a fixture, it can even be moving!  The same is true for placing an item- it can be in a pallet that moves or is not in a consistent position.<br /><br />Our bottom line:  Lower investment, flexibility and faster performance means higher ROI.{% endraw %}
