Stop a possessed cult leader before she drags you to hell with her. Run. Scream. Hide. Just don't get caught.<br /><br />HAVE YOU GOT NERVES OF STEEL?<br /><br />2-4 player online co-op<br /><br />Take control of up to 4 cult members in this unique online co-op experience where you must work together to stop Anna, a possessed cult leader dead set on taking you to hell with her.<br /><br />Single player mode<br /><br />For hardcore players only. In this mode, you'll be doing all the screaming yourself.<br /><br />Challenging gameplay<br /><br />No two DEVOUR playthroughs are ever the same. To stop Anna, you’ll need a focused team and perfect execution, with a single session lasting up to an hour.<br /><br />CAN YOU STOP THE DEMONIC CULT LEADER?<br /><br />Anna Puerta, leader of demonic cult The Watchers of Azazel, has just performed a forbidden ritual, believing she can summon and control the goat demon himself. But something has gone wrong, and Azazel has possessed her.<br /><br />Exorcise Anna<br /><br />Your goal is to break Azazel's hold over Anna. To do this you'll need to find gasoline, a fire pit, and enough ritual goats to burn.<br /><br />Escalating difficulty<br /><br />Anna's rage and speed increase as the game progresses, as does the number of demons Azazel spawns to stop you. Your only means of defence is your UV flashlight.<br /><br />Replayability<br /><br />Locked doors, goats and item spawns are randomized, ensuring that no two games are the same. What's more, DEVOUR's unpredictable AI ups the game, making you second guess each and every move.<br /><br />Nightmare mode<br /><br />Beat the game without breaking a sweat? Try Nightmare mode for the ultimate challenge.<br /><br />Multiplayer features<br /><br />Make use of our in-game positional voice chat. Bring friends, or find other players using the server browser.<br /><br />The Watchers<br /><br />DEVOUR is the prequel to the 2-player online co-op game The Watchers. Play as Anna's estranged children Luisa and Frederico as they search for their missing mother.<br /><br />MATURE CONTENT DESCRIPTION<br />The developers describe the content like this:<br /><br />This Game may contain content not appropriate for all ages, or may not be appropriate for viewing at work: Frequent Violence or Gore, General Mature Content<br />__________________________________________<br />#DEVOUR{% endraw %}
