{% raw %}2017 was a year to remember at National Park Trust! From coast to coast we have worked to preserve significant acreage in 4 National Parks and provided more than 20,000 under-served students with park experiences! Thanks to our generous supporters we have made great strides in our mission to preserve parks today and create park stewards for tomorrow. Please keep the momentum going www.parktrust.org/donate<br /><br />Music: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bensound.com">https://www.bensound.com</a>{% endraw %}
