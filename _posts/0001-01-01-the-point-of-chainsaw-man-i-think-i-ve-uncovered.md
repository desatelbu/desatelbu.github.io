{% raw %}I think I've uncovered something amazing.  The point of chainsaw man, a thematic analysis but also analysis of the extratextual material that is so tied to all the series does.  Let's talk cooooool.<br /><br />Chainsaw Man is a manga by Tatsuki Fujimoto getting a new anime soon.  It stars Denji who starts as a devil hunter under Makima in a squad including Devilman Power and nice boy Aki.  The end of Chainsaw man was confusing for a lot of people but I hope this can make some sense of it.{% endraw %}
