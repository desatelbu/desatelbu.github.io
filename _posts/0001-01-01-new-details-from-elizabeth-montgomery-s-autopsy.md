Montgomery embodied that role masterfully for eight seasons between 1964 and 1972. The show continues to air throughout the world in syndication as a new generation of audience members are introduced to her quirky, witchy ways.<br /><br />Elizabeth Montgomery became a household name for her portrayal as that beloved witch, but she didn't just fall into her prolific forty-year career by accident. Her father, Robert Montgomery, was a film star who was honored with two Academy Award nominations, and her mother, Elizabeth Allen, was an equally gifted Broadway star. Elizabeth's storied life and career came to an end on May 18, 1995, when she suddenly and unexpectedly passed away after a short battle with colon cancer. She was only 64 when she died.<br /><br />Montgomery is said to have only experienced worrisome symptoms for six weeks before her biopsy results indicated that her cancer had already reached stage IV. Oddly though, colon cancer is typically considered to be one of the easiest to prevent forms of cancer, and beyond that, it's normally regarded as one of the easiest to treat. So, why on earth did she seem to be hit with it apparently out of the blue at a point where it was already much too late to do anything about it? Watch this video to learn about the new details that have been revealed about her autopsy that raise some seriously disturbing questions about her final days.<br /><br />New Details From Elizabeth Montgomery’s Autopsy Change Everything{% endraw %}
