{% raw %}Hey! thanks for watching! My name is Mitch and I live in Central South Carolina. I started off mainly talking about weather specifically for South Carolina, but have started to expand to the Eastern US. I am not a Meteorologist, I am just a guy that is passionate about weather, and that loves sharing what I know with others! I also love chasing extreme weather. I have a playlist on my channel with numerous chase videos. <br /><br />I am very active on Twitter &amp; Facebook:<br /><br />Facebook link:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/SCweatherwx">https://www.facebook.com/SCweatherwx</a><br /><br />Twitter link:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/SCweather_wx">https://twitter.com/SCweather_wx</a> (very active)<br /><br />As always, thank you for the support!
