He also asked if people were out looking for him.<br /><br />She told him to wait for a call from his son, who was going to go out and find him, but Brown didn‚Äôt answer the phone after that. And nobody has been able to find him, even though hundreds of people out there helping with the search.<br /><br />This series documents Adventures With Purpose's multi-day search for Ralph.<br /><br />WATCH ALL 7 EPISODES<br />=====================<br />Ep1 - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/g-egFj38rPA">https://youtu.be/g-egFj38rPA</a><br />Ep2 - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/jzxfkI58O0g">https://youtu.be/jzxfkI58O0g</a><br />Ep3 - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/o0pTCvdnKhY">https://youtu.be/o0pTCvdnKhY</a><br />Ep4 - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/KLgL65Rwp1E">https://youtu.be/KLgL65Rwp1E</a> <br />Ep5 - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/taVOwPJqA4k">https://youtu.be/taVOwPJqA4k</a> <br />Ep6 - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/6ybNyRPMbG0">https://youtu.be/6ybNyRPMbG0</a> <br />Ep7 - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/U9CaouVXTss">https://youtu.be/U9CaouVXTss</a> (Out Now for Members)<br /><br />Brown is 76 years old, about 5-foot-10, with white hair and blue eyes. He's also missing the tip of his index finger. <br /><br />His car is a dark blue, 2014 Nissan Sentra with Oregon plates. <br /><br />Anyone who sees him or his car is asked to call the Washington County Sheriff‚Äôs Office at 503-629-0111<br /><br />There have been a few sightings reported, but none were substantiated, said Daryle Brown, Ralph Brown‚Äôs son.<br /><br />Daryle said his parents were in their home on May 16 when Brown stood up and said he was going to his ‚Äúother house.‚Äù <br /><br />Ralph has early-onset Alzheimer‚Äôs symptoms, which leads to confusion. He no longer has a driver‚Äôs license and has not driven a car in more than a year, Daryle said.<br /><br />He drove away from the home in the 600 block of South 12th Avenue in Cornelius, Oregon. <br /><br />There have been no location pings on his phone after 10:25pm that evening, and no communication from Brown in the time since he‚Äôs been missing. <br /><br />There have also been no charges to his credit card.<br /><br />More than 200 volunteers are still helping in the search, including former students, friends, and even strangers.<br /><br />Do we feel this is a true crime with foul play or simply a missing persons cold case accident? In our opinion, there are no signs of foul play we are aware of. <br /><br />Hug the ones you love for you never know when it might be the last time you see them. <br /><br />We are humbled by the opportunity all of you have given us to help in the search for answers as to what happened to Ralph.<br /><br />The AWP Movement would not be possible without your support, helping us travel the US offering our services for FREE to families searching for their lost loved ones... Thank you!<br /><br />We'll be hitting the road on Sept 17th for a 44-day cross-country road trip, working 27 Cold Cases, searching for 36 missing people. <br /><br />==========<br /><br />üé¨üçø Watch More of Our Episodes<br /><br />SOLVED: Found Tammy Goff (Ep. 4) Missing 3-Years Underwater<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/g8TQ2aPeTco">https://youtu.be/g8TQ2aPeTco</a><br /><br />SOLVED 8-Month-Old Missing Person Case (Nicholas Allen)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/cAfYtXB-qN4">https://youtu.be/cAfYtXB-qN4</a><br /><br />SOLVED 7-Year-Old Missing Person Case..
