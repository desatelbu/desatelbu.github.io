{% raw %}There are plenty of B negative men.  Blood type doesn't trend toward a certain gender.  I've head 4 different 4 negative individuals suggest this theory(descendant from Jesus) to me in last 2 weeks.<br />Washed in the blood.  <br />Met latest b negative woman named maria.  We are very simliar.  <br />I talk about women I've met no one specifically who are b negative named maria or marie from all over world.<br />If you had a shot during pregnancy you are likely rh negative<br /> if you have shot and you have fairer skin reddish hair and green eyes you are more likely o negative in general.<br /><br />Blood running through the veins.{% endraw %}
