{% raw %}This 30 min complete upper body workout with dumbbells MASH UP is an excellent way to burning calories + build muscle. We're going to work the entire upper body: chest, back and  shoulders. This is a great complete upper body workout at home, all you need is a mat and two sets of dumbbells. I'm using 30 lb / 13.6 kg dumbbells in this workout.<br /><br />In this upper body workout, if an exercise isn't challenging enough then pick up heavier weights. If an exercise is too challenging, use lighter weights. <br /><br />Work hard, take breaks as needed and let's have a great workout!<br /><br />Don't forget to warm up before your workout!<br />👉🏼  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/-BBlDbn4QBo">https://youtu.be/-BBlDbn4QBo</a><br /><br />30 Min Upper Body Workout Details<br /><br />👉🏼 Duration: 30 Mins<br />👉🏼 Equipment: Two sets of dumbbells (I'm using 30 lb / 13.6 kg and 20 lb / 9 kg dumbbells) and a mat.<br />🦍 We use and highly recommend Yo Gorilla Mats Premium Large Exercise Mat!
