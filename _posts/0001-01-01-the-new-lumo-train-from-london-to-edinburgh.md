{% raw %}There's a new train operator in town! A few years ago, there was an offer for an Open Access Operator to run services up the East Coast Mainline, and starting with two return trips a day (this will later increase to five) that's exactly what LUMO are doing, with their 'one class only' five carriage train, it's a very cheap way to travel ...<br /><br />Things which didn't make the edit:<br /><br />Legroom on seats - note that there are 'priority seats' which give you EXTRA legroom which was great - I can't work out how to reserve these on their website though.  Also, there are just TWO highly coveted table seats in each carriage, again I didn't try booking a table seat but I beat these will be highly sought after. The WiFi works a treat too, and lets you to connect to their onboard streaming service which worked flawlessly for me.<br /><br />I *really do* think think they should remove two of the windowless seats in each carriage, and turn them into luggage rucks instead.  But that's not Lumo's fault thought - that falls squarly with the DfT/RDG who specified how many seats their train needed to have and they had to go with that.<br /><br />Book tickets at the official Lumo Website : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.lumo.co.uk/">https://www.lumo.co.uk/</a><br /><br />Roger's Blog (A must read) : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://busandtrainuser.com/2021/10/27/luggage-looms-large-on-lumo-but-not-refreshments/">https://busandtrainuser.com/2021/10/27/luggage-looms-large-on-lumo-but-not-refreshments/</a><br /><br />Chelsea from Cheap Holiday Expert : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cheapholidayexpert.com/blog/how-find-cheap-lumo-train-fares-from-london-to-newcastle-and-edinburgh/">https://cheapholidayexpert.com/blog/how-find-cheap-lumo-train-fares-from-london-to-newcastle-and-edinburgh/</a><br /><br />Secret Link to Tom Walker performance : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/dNlWQxR08lQ">https://youtu.be/dNlWQxR08lQ</a><br /><br />On the train I also bumped into Michael who's made a fun video too which I appear in!
