The mobility part is for a child who needs help getting around.<br /><br />A child can get money for one, or both parts.<br /><br />The care part can be claimed from birth. It has 3 rates: lowest, middle or highest.<br /><br />The rate of care a child can get is based on how much extra help they need during the day, at night or both.<br /><br />The mobility part has 2 rates. A child can be awarded lower rate from age 5 or higher rate from age 3.<br /><br />The rate of mobility a child can get is based on what extra help they need getting around. <br /><br />The child must have had their care or mobility needs for 3 months, which will last at least a further 6 months, unless they are terminally ill.<br /><br />If the child is terminally ill, there are special rules in place so we award DLA quicker.<br /><br />A DLA claim must be made by the person looking after the child.<br /><br />To make a DLA claim you must be aged 16 or over if you are the child’s parent.<br /><br />If you are the child’s guardian or carer you must be over 18.<br /><br />It does not matter if the person making the claim is working, has savings or has other money coming in.<br /><br />A DLA claim can be affected by where the child lives in the UK and if they have ever lived abroad.<br /><br />For more information on Disability Living Allowance (DLA) for children you can go online to:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/dla-child">https://www.gov.uk/dla-child</a><br /> <br />You can contact our helpline by:<br /><br />Telephone on 0800 121 4600<br />Textphone on 0800 121 4523<br />Relay UK service on 18001 followed by 0800 121 4600<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br /><br />We are unable to respond to enquiries on YouTube. <br /><br />Please visit GOV.UK to find the relevant information.{% endraw %}
