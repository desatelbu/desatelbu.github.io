{% raw %}Of course the one flower i was aiming at for the closeup shot didn't fully grow into a bell pepper. I tried aiming at some new flowers to capture the full transformation but the rest of the flowers just started to fall off. Could be the infestation of small white bugs that have attacked the rest of the plants in the studio as well. I'm not completely sure what they are, you can actually see them crawl around at 1:23. Maybe i will remake this one in a year or so.<br /><br />But overall I'm happy with the results although no complete flower to fruit shot. At least you can see them in the background growing and turning white :) <br /><br />See you next time!<br /><br />Music from epidemic sound: Spring Morning - Peter Sandberg<br /><br />Epidemic sound 30 day free trial: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://share.epidemicsound.com/3pS7H8">http://share.epidemicsound.com/3pS7H8</a><br /><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiL9l2J57t5OG2aZ0huswZw?sub_confirmation=1">http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiL9l2J57t5OG2aZ0huswZw?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />Socials<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/Boxlapsefilms/">https://www.instagram.com/Boxlapsefilms/</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Boxlapse/">https://www.facebook.com/Boxlapse/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/boxlapse">https://twitter.com/boxlapse</a>{% endraw %}
