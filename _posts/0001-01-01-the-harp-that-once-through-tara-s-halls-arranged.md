{% raw %}Arranged by Ryan Malone for unaccompanied SATB chorus<br />Performed by Junior Ambassadors of Imperial Academy<br />(Ages 11-17)<br />Armstrong Auditorium, Dec. 11, 2014<br /><br />By Thomas Moore (1779-1852)<br />The harp that once through Tara’s halls<br />The soul of music shed,<br />Now hangs as mute on Tara’s walls<br />As if that soul were fled.<br />So sleeps the pride of former days,<br />So glory’s thrill is o’er,<br />And hearts, that once beat high for praise,<br />Now feel that pulse no more.<br /><br />No more to chiefs and ladies bright<br />The harp of Tara swells:<br />The chord alone, that breaks at night,<br />Its tale of ruin tells.<br />Thus Freedom now so seldom wakes,<br />The only throb she gives,<br />Is when some heart indignant breaks,<br />To show that still she lives.{% endraw %}
