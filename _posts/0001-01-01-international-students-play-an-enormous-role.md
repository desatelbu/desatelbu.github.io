{% raw %}International students have been given the green light to return to Australia as the country begins to reopen. <br /><br />Universities Australia CEO Catriona Jackson says international students play &quot;an enormous part&quot; in the nation's society and economy. <br /><br />&quot;There are 130,000 students just waiting who've already got visas who are studying online who are very, very, keen to get back into the country for first semester,&quot; Ms Jackson told Sky News Australia. <br /><br />&quot;Also, students will be considering their options - thinking about where they study - we want them to come and study here because Australia's a great place to study and they play an enormous part in our, both society, but also let's be honest about it, in our economy,&quot; she said.{% endraw %}
