I fell in love with the markets in the early 2000s and have been obsessed with trading and investing ever since. In 2012, I was fortunate enough to be able to leave my job in banking to focus on my private trading full-time. <br /><br />I have been lucky to work with and learn from fantastic people over the years, which has helped me develop further as a trader and make some fascinating discoveries in the markets. I hope by sharing some of this with you through The Duomo Initiative I can help you find your own passion for the markets too. There is so much more to trading than just the financial side; experiencing the magic of discovery can make this journey even more rewarding!<br /><br />#Trading{% endraw %}
