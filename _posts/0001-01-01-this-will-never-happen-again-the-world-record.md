From the Olympic Games, to the World Championships, to the highest marks ever recorded in this event, Železný has forever cemented his legacy as quite possibly the greatest javelin thrower to ever live.<br /><br />Thanks for watching.  <br />=========================================<br />*Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for &quot;fair use&quot; for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
