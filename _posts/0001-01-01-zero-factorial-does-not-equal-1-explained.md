{% raw %}How you been told that zero factorial equals one (0! = 1)? If you did, then stop and watch this video! In it I show why explanations for this are either flawed or JUST PLAIN WRONG! Come see how to think of what zero factorial equals!<br /><br />Videos explaining factorials sometimes explain why zero factorial is 1 (for example, numberphile) either use explanations that don't really prove what zero factorial equals, or give &quot;proofs&quot; which are incorrect. In this video I go through these explanations in detail. I also show exactly how to think of zero factorial (0!).{% endraw %}
