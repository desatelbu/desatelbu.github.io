{% raw %}This place is part of my homestead.<br />The animals (LAMP, YONA, and GWIN) stay in the main house, except when I bring them here occasionally. They don't sleep curled up together, but they don't fight and keep a good distance from each other.<br /> <br />This is not a how-to video.<br />The method I'm using is not necessarily the right one. Nowadays, you can find out the right way to do things by searching on Google. If you only want results, that's fine too.<br />But for me, the most important thing is not whether a method is right or wrong, but to experience firsthand why it succeeds or fails.<br />All work is done personally and at my own risk.<br />Please enjoy it as entertainment only.<br /><br />The products can be purchased.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/brcke">https://teespring.com/stores/brcke</a>{% endraw %}
