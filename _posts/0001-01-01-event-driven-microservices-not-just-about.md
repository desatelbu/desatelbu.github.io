They pop up almost everywhere in different shapes and forms, and for different reasons. Unfortunately, they often completely miss their purpose, and instead of decoupling components, they subtly introduce an implicit coupling in logic.<br />The distributed big ball of mud is born.<br />Throwing more technologies at it won't solve the problem, all it will do is simply introduce a new layer of mud on top of the old.<br />In this session, I will take a few steps back and look at three reasons why components need to communicate.
