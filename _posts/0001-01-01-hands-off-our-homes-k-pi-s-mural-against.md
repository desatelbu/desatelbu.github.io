{% raw %}A massive mural is created on the side of Køpi to draw attention to the imminent threat of eviction of their Wagenplatz. A crew of abseiling graffiti artists illuminates the Berlin skyline and the Køpi community opens its doors and welcomes you into their multitude of DIY spaces.<br /><br />Køpi and Wagenplatz have been a self-organised cultural project for more than 30 years and also a living space for people of all ages and different origins. Some of them have even lived here for several generations. These places have always been important points of contact for political and artistic collectives from all over the world.<br /><br />The Køpi has been totally independent of state funding or sponsors since its start. It is a strictly non-commercial project and internationally known for that. Unfortunately, the Køpi is one of the last such spaces along the banks of the Spree. To this day, it has successfully fought against the threat of displacement by investors and large corporations whose only interests are building expensive offices and other glass palaces for the rich. <br /><br />When the building was occupied in 1990 the Spree embankment was the heart and pulse of Berlin’s subculture, surrounded by other caravans and projects like the EastsideGallery, alternative clubs and cheap rental flats. But now it is one of the most expensive areas in Berlin.<br /><br />The mural was born out of the idea to create more publicity for this free space and to make clearly visible that there are alternatives to capitalist urban development that are important to defend. It was painted within a week by a group of Berlin sprayers, mural painting groups and artists who have felt connected to the place for many years. Like many others, they have grown up with it, celebrated, lived, worked there, and want to continue to do so!<br /><br />Hands off our homes – Köpi bleibt Risikokapital!<br /><br />Video and Mural:<br />Reclaim Your City / Köpi <br />May/June 2021<br />Instagram: @ryc_berlin<br /><br />Music: <br />Robkob 600e - Mord<br />Robkob 600e - Hunde Playback<br />Zaraza - Bring Them Hell<br /><br />Köpi Website:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://koepi137.net/welcome.html">https://koepi137.net/welcome.html</a><br />Twitter:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/KopiBleibt">https://twitter.com/KopiBleibt</a><br />Telegram:<br />t.me/KopiNewsBerlin<br /><br />Foto-Galleries:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://umbruch-bildarchiv.org/koepi-wagenplatz-bleibt/">https://umbruch-bildarchiv.org/koepi-wagenplatz-bleibt/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://umbruch-bildarchiv.org/koepi-wagenplatz-bleibt-teil-2/">https://umbruch-bildarchiv.org/koepi-wagenplatz-bleibt-teil-2/</a>{% endraw %}
