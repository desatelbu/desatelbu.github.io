{% raw %}Let's talk about the finance side of my car collection and how I work with Approved Motor Finance to buy and manage the money side of the supercars. We've also got a second Lamborghini in the garage, and plenty of progress cleaning up the Shmuseum!<br /><br />There's no specific formula behind how to buy and pay for a car; everybody will be different in their circumstances and of course they way I go about it is quite unique. However, with some cars that are financed from new, some that have been re-financed, and some that are owned outright, let's talk through some of the pros and cons of why these options make sense with a look at the Shmeemobiles, joined by Krish from AMF with a fabulous Lamborghini Huracan Performante.<br /><br />In today's vlog at @The Shmuseum we also have a new carpet for the office that takes quite some effort to put in place, as well as a lot of work to be done for the cleaning of the floor thanks to the loan of a suitable machine from Cleaning Equipment Services.<br /><br />You can find much more information about Approved Motor Finance here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.approvedmotorfinance.co.uk/shmee150">http://www.approvedmotorfinance.co.uk/shmee150</a><br /><br />Thanks also to Cleaning Equipment Services:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cleaningequipmentservices.uk">https://cleaningequipmentservices.uk</a><br /><br />Thanks for watching!{% endraw %}
