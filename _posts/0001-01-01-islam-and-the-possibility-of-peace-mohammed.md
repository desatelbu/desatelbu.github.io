The importance of the original version of the Quran<br />[35:07] “Islam is an evangelizing religion... we want everyone to embrace it.” MH<br />[35:31] Bridges to Islam<br />[38:50] “I’m speaking from the perspective of someone who’s a traditionalist Muslim and not a liberal or enlightened Muslim.” MH<br />[40:47] An abridged story of the prophet Muhammad.
