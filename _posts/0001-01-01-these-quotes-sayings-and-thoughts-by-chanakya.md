{% raw %}Chanakya was an ancient Indian teacher, philosopher, economist, jurist and royal advisor. He is traditionally identified as Kauá¹­ilya or Vishnugupta, who authored the ancient Indian political treatise, the Arthashastra, a text dated to roughly between the 4th century BCE and the 3rd century CE. As such, he is considered the pioneer of the field of political science and economics in India, and his work is thought of as an important precursor to classical economics. His works were lost near the end of the Gupta Empire in the 6th century CE and not rediscovered until the early 20th century. <br />Chanakya assisted the first Mauryan emperor Chandragupta in his rise to power. He is widely credited for having played an important role in the establishment of the Maurya Empire. Chanakya served as the chief advisor to both emperors Chandragupta and his son Bindusara. <br />This video highlights the best quotes, sayings and thoughts by Chanakya; enjoy!<br />#Chanakya #Quotes #thewiseman<br /><br />ðŸ””  SUBSCRIBE NOW for more content like this: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB5V6984Me4S77xiOkMOo1g?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB5V6984Me4S77xiOkMOo1g?sub_confirmation=1</a><br />ðŸ‘‰ Watch more<br />My favorite playlist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLg5oV8XYn0KesOwMdH_GufW3OOhKy6D1n">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLg5oV8XYn0KesOwMdH_GufW3OOhKy6D1n</a>{% endraw %}
