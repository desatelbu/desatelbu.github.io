{% raw %}Jaguar Land Rover, the UK’s largest vehicle manufacturer, is expanding the use of recycled aluminium in its car bodies to cut waste and reduce carbon emissions.<br /><br />The £2 million project, called REALITY, has found a way to enable the closed-loop recycling of aluminium from end-of-life vehicles back into high-performance product forms for new vehicle body manufacture in the UK by Jaguar Land Rover.<br /><br />REALITY builds on the REALCAR project allowing tens of thousands of tonnes of aluminium generated in the manufacturing process to be recycled and reused as a closed-loop. Aluminium from other sources, including  end-of-life vehicles, can now be graded and ‘born again’ in the manufacture of new cars.<br /><br />This unique ‘closed-loop’ automotive recycling system helps to further develop the circular economy model to deliver both financial and environmental benefits.<br /><br />The project, part-funded by Innovate UK, has involved more than 10 press shops (Jaguar Land Rover and external suppliers) with aluminium being remelted by Novelis.<br /><br />&quot;Innovate UK is proud of our support for the REALCAR programme, and this exciting latest stage of the project, REALITY, is another excellent example of collaboration between large and small businesses in the supply chain, supporting them to scale up and become more productive. These projects have been a model in terms of professional delivery of complex research and development.&quot; - Simon Edmunds, director of manufacturing and materials at Innovate UK.<br /><br />View other Innovate UK success stories here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIOhloXRq2E&amp;list=PLrMOhOrmeR6lMh1j4Qz_csh_3ljSrDZpj">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIOhloXRq2E&amp;list=PLrMOhOrmeR6lMh1j4Qz_csh_3ljSrDZpj</a><br /><br />Subscribe to the Innovate UK YouTube channel here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Innovateuk?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/user/Innovateuk?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />Follow us on Twitter for all the latest in UK innovation: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/innovateuk">https://twitter.com/innovateuk</a><br /><br />#InnovateUK #IndustrialStrategy #CleanGrowth{% endraw %}
