{% raw %}During the dark days of the Covid 19 pandemic, when most of us where locked down, and our world was struggling with the dire consequences of fear and uncertainty, many folks were scared and bitter. Families lost loved ones, many folks lost their jobs and businesses and our entire support system laid in balance. <br /><br />In the middle of such storms the challenge was and still is; is there reason to be grateful and praise God? <br /><br />In the middle of all that, the Ambassadors of Christ said and still say...There are still a million reasons to be grateful...and that is what this new video NASHIMWE is about. Join us as we sing along and proclaim to a terrified world that God is good and deserving of our Gratitude.<br /><br />AMBASSADORS OF CHRIST CHOIR NASHIMWE - Official Video 2021 Be sure to SUBSCRIBE, LIKE, SHARE and FOLLOW the Ambassadors of Christ on this channel, but ALSO on:<br /><br /> Facebook Page: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Ambassadors-...">https://www.facebook.com/Ambassadors-...</a> <br />Website: www.ambassadorsofchristchoir.org <br />Instagram: @ Ambassadors of Christ Choir<br /> Email: ambassadorsocc@gmail.com <br />SONG CREDITS: Words, Music &amp; Arrangement: BY SSOZI JORAM <br />Voicing &amp; Audio Editing: James @ Ambassadors of Christ Choir Studio<br />Instrumentation Credits: Kirunda James (Amani Records)<br />Video Credits: Meddy Saleh<br />Venue Credits: M-Hotel Kigali<br />Audio rights: Exclusively by Ambassadors of Christ Choir, recorded @ Ambassadors of Christ studio. <br />Video rights exclusively owned by Ambassadors of Christ Choir <br /><br />Song Lyrics: There is a lyrics version uploaded on this channel<br /><br />Ambassadors of Christ Choir is not currently in agreement with anyone to license the Music in our Videos.
