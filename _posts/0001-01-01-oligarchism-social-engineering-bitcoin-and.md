{% raw %}In this episode of the Keyvan Davani Connection, Matt Ehret unpacks a variety of topics. We discuss the League of Cambrai of 1509 which nearly wiped out the financier oligarchy then centered in the lagoons of Venice before the parasite migrated to &quot;safer&quot; terrain in Amsterdam and then England, and we also trace this oligarchy's efforts to take over the United States from 1776-present. <br /><br />We discuss the multipolar alliance of Russia and China which have ironically invoked the best principles of the American System of political economy, and we also address the fraud of green energy, how science became coopted, the fraud of Darwin and Newton specifically, and we also take aim at the fraud of Austrian School economics from Carl Menger to Von Hayek to Friedman and the present. Lastly, Matt and Keyvan debate the potency of Bitcoin and its role in shaping a just new system.<br /><br />Support the work by any of the following ways:<br /><br />1) Make a donation to the Canadian Patriot, or Rising Tide Foundation <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/canadianpatriot">https://www.patreon.com/canadianpatriot</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://canadianpatriot.org/support-us/">https://canadianpatriot.org/support-us/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://risingtidefoundation.net/support-the-work/">https://risingtidefoundation.net/support-the-work/</a><br /><br />2) Subscribe to Matt and Cynthia's Substack<br />matthewehret.substack.com<br />cynthiachung.substack.com<br /><br />3) Buy some books!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://canadianpatriot.org/untold-history-of-canada-books/">https://canadianpatriot.org/untold-history-of-canada-books/</a>{% endraw %}
