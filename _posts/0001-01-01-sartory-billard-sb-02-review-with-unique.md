{% raw %}The SB02 from the French company Sartory Billard is unique in that the watch is customizable by changing out the bezel on the top of the watch. <br /><br />Sartory Billard offers bezels for the SB02 in a variety of colors and finishes and even some that are hand-engraved. In this in-depth video review, I’ll show a couple of different bezel and strap options and discus the unique case design of the Sartory Billard SB02.<br /><br />Prices for the SB02 start at 542 Euros including VAT<br /><br />For more information, visit www.sartory-billard.com{% endraw %}
