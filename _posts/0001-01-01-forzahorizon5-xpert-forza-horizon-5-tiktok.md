{% raw %}BeamNG.drive uses a real-time soft-body physics structure to simulate its vehicles. Please subscribe to beamng channel - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/AQoxXL9IIKA">https://youtu.be/AQoxXL9IIKA</a><br /><br />Algorithms have been written for the physics equations to be carried out. It relies heavily on coding in Lua, and uses packets of local data using the Lua network system while the game is running. The game's engine constantly calculates physics equations and problems in real-time during gameplay.<br /><br />Vehicles in the game consist of a soft-body node-beam structure similar to those in Rigs of Rods. The physics engine simulates a network of interconnected nodes and beams, which combine to form an invisible skeleton of a vehicle with realistic weights and masses. In terms of soft-body physics, vehicles realistically flex and deform as stresses to the skeleton, such as impacts from collisions, are applied. Aside from body deformation, various other types of damage are simulated such as degraded engine, detached doors and shattered windows. If a vehicle is severely damaged, the engine may fail, rendering the vehicle unusable; additionally, the vehicle will also fail from damage to the driveshaft, clutch, and other important components that can result in catastrophic failure to the vehicle. Also, tyres can be blown out and fuel tanks may explode after an excessive amount of collisions. <br /><br />#beamng #tiktok #cars<br /><br />=====================================<br /><br />TIKTOK compilations every day!
