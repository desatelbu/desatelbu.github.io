{% raw %}Today we lay individual bags between bottles in hopes of not breaking them, but an accidental trip causes us to break one anyway. Also, we make some tiny tasty pies for Mason Jar Monday.<br /><br />Mini Apple Pie Recipe<br /><br />Start with a good pie crust. This is my favorite recipe - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.inspiredtaste.net/22662/flaky-pie-crust-recipe/">https://www.inspiredtaste.net/22662/flaky-pie-crust-recipe/</a><br />Form the pie crusts in the Ball Jar lids and keep in freezer until you're ready to put it all together and bake.<br />Chop up apples into tiny pieces and squeeze some lime or lemon juice on them.<br />Cook with 1/2 T Butter, Cinnamon and Nutmeg (to your liking) and a dash of salt.<br />Once it's just starting to get a little soft turn off the heat and add a teaspoon of honey (or more depending on your variety of apples.<br />Roll out the other dough to use for lattice.<br />Fill mini pies just like you would a big pie and add the lattice top, and trim off extra.<br />Bake at 375 until done. I like to pull them out after about 20 minutes and add some melted butter to the top because my RV oven does not like to brown anything. <br />Pop it back in for another 20-30 minutes or until the crust is cooked and there you have it! Delicious mini apple pies :)<br /><br />LINKS//<br />HYPERADOBE BAGS: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyshinyhome.com/hyperadobebag">https://tinyshinyhome.com/hyperadobebag</a><br />MEMBERSHIP: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyshinyhome.com/homies">https://tinyshinyhome.com/homies</a><br />WEBSITE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyshinyhome.com">https://tinyshinyhome.com</a><br />30 DAY YOUTUBE CHALLENGE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyshinyhome.com/youtube30">https://tinyshinyhome.com/youtube30</a><br />NINE NINE : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.strongdoodles.com">http://www.strongdoodles.com</a><br />INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/tinyshinyhome">https://www.instagram.com/tinyshinyhome</a><br />FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/tinyshinyhome">https://facebook.com/tinyshinyhome</a><br />COURSES: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyshinyhome.com/products">https://tinyshinyhome.com/products</a><br />AIRSTREAM RENOVATION: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyshinyhome.com/airstream">https://tinyshinyhome.com/airstream</a><br />SUPPORT US BY SHOPPING ON AMAZON: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyshinyhome.com/amazonaffiliate">https://tinyshinyhome.com/amazonaffiliate</a> <br />MUSIC: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://artlist.io">https://artlist.io</a><br /><br />We have an affiliate partnership with some of the links above, and may receive compensation when items are sold.
