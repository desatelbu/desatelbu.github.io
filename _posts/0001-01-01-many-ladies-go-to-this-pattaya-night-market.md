{% raw %}teprasit night market <br /><br />Not a huge market - but will take some time to walk around. Don't expect Chatuchak market, but there are plenty of vendors and food stalls. I would still budget around two hours to walk around. Huge variety of food available. Prices for goods are only slightly higher than Chatuchak, but only a few baht. More for locals than a tourist trap, so prices aren't hugely inflated. Same items you would see for sale in many stores/malls in Pattaya but prices are better. Well worth a visit when in the area.<br /><br /><br />please subscribe{% endraw %}
