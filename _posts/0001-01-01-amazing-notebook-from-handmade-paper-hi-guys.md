{% raw %}Hi, guys! We bet everyone has a few dozen pieces of old paper at home. But don't rush to throw them away. Cause today we're going to show you a pretty amazing way of how to give them a second life.<br /><br />So, what should we do? We'll start with tearing big sheets of paper into strips about 2 centimetres wide each. Then we will mix them with water in a blender. Get ready, it will be noisy! This consistency reminds us of porridge and we want to give it a little brightness. It is extremely important to protect your hands during this process. Latex gloves will do perfectly! Divide our paper pulp into several parts and add a tiny bit of food coloring to it. You can add glitter, flowers, and whatever you want to the mix! Show your imagination!<br /><br />Next, we use a silicone mold to pour the mass into it and start spreading it evenly. And press a towel on top to remove excess moisture. Then we should leave it to dry properly. That'll take several hours! In the same way, we will create other sheets of paper in different colors and patterns. And don't forget, our notebook needs covers. We will make it using epoxy resin. The result will be amazing! Do not miss it!<br /><br />Guys, did you like our craft today? And the best part is, you can get creative and make any kind of a new notebook from old paper!<br /><br />Watch more cool tutorials on our channel:<br /><br />How To Transform Lego Human Into A TITAN <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/4hDHt96n0k4">https://youtu.be/4hDHt96n0k4</a><br /><br />DIY A Sea-Themed Clock <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/AlOISpK_GP4">https://youtu.be/AlOISpK_GP4</a><br /><br />Making Our Own Gizmo Out Of Old Bratz Doll <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/0UBU-3MpJks">https://youtu.be/0UBU-3MpJks</a> <br /><br />This video has English subtitles for your convenience!<br />- - - <br />Shop our awesome t-shorts, pop-sockets, and more on Teespring Store <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3fHWRn6">https://bit.ly/3fHWRn6</a> <br />- - - <br />Check out Slime Sam's Community Tab and see his best pictures, funny GIFs, new episode announcements and much more! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw5VDXH8up3pKUppIvcstNQ/community">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw5VDXH8up3pKUppIvcstNQ/community</a><br /><br />Subscribe to Sam's channel and give a thumbs up to motivate him to make more videos for you! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/zarVZo">https://goo.gl/zarVZo</a><br />- - - <br />All product and company names shown in the video are trademarks™ or registered® trademarks of their respective holders.
