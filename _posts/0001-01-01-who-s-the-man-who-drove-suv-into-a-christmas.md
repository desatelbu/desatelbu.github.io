{% raw %}A 39-year-old amateur rapper is in custody after allegedly driving into spectators at a holiday parade in Waukesha, Wisconsin, on Sunday, killing five people and injuring at least 48 others. Harrowing videos taken at the parade show chaos as the SUV speeds through the crowd. Police say Darrell Brooks deliberately plowed his SUV into the revellers, allegedly while fleeing after a domestic dispute. Documents obtained by Inside Edition show Brooks has a history of allegedly using his SUV as a weapon.{% endraw %}
