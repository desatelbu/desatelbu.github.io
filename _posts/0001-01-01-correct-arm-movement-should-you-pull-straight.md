{% raw %}Should you pull straight back or should you move your hand in an S shape? We know the answer. We also know it’s going to help you swim faster. But this is a decades long debate. So, we have to explain this as best as we can to convince you to try it. You will probably love it, tell others about it and then they will tell you that you’re crazy. You’ll send them this video and the cycle will begin again. Soon we will all be swimming faster and with a safer technique for the shoulders. <br /><br />Our dry-land channel:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMx5IKVnc7RfNCs2TyjoLuw">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMx5IKVnc7RfNCs2TyjoLuw</a><br /><br />Swimming camps:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://skillswimming.com/swimming-camp/">https://skillswimming.com/swimming-camp/</a><br /><br />Join our Discord (swimming community):<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/tsSb4P2qyA">https://discord.gg/tsSb4P2qyA</a><br /><br />If you like swimming, you will like our webpage:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://skillswimming.com/swimming/">https://skillswimming.com/swimming/</a><br /><br />Tik tok:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@skillsntalents">https://www.tiktok.com/@skillsntalents</a><br /><br />Our favorite Amazon products:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/SkillsNAmazon">http://bit.ly/SkillsNAmazon</a><br /><br />Instragram:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/skillsntalents">https://www.instagram.com/skillsntalents</a><br /><br />Facebook:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/SkillsNTalents">https://www.facebook.com/SkillsNTalents</a><br /><br />Thanks for watching!<br />Swim fast!<br /><br /><br />00:00 - The debate<br />01:23 - My experience<br />01:32 - The Best Swimmers do this<br />01:40 - Three problems with straight back<br />02:27 - S Pull<br />03:02 - Main focus<br /><br /><br />Sources:<br /><br />Taormina Sheila.
