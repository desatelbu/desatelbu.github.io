{% raw %}Sky News host Chris Kenny says Joe Biden's staff probably &quot;can't wait&quot; to get him home to bed in the White House as the president's gaffes, stumbles and confusion just continue – but not before he has to face Russian President Vladimir Putin.<br /><br />&quot;Biden is going to be representing the interests of the free world when he confronts the belligerent Russian president in their Geneva summit tomorrow,&quot; Mr Kenny said.<br /><br />Mr Kenny said Joe Biden went from &quot;Russian collusion&quot; to &quot;Russian delusion&quot; when asked by a reporter if he still stood by past comments he made as a candidate that Vladimir Putin was a &quot;killer&quot;. <br /><br />The president's response was &quot;awkward&quot;.<br /><br />&quot;I guess he's saying yeah he is a killer but that doesn't matter now, it's more than awkward isn't it,&quot; Mr Kenny said.<br /><br />&quot;Biden can only work by reading a script, once he wanders off on his own, no one knows where he's gonna end up. <br /><br />&quot;It's a worry for the US, for you and me – but not for Putin.&quot;{% endraw %}
