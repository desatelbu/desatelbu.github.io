{% raw %}CL is the Queen, wbk. The 2nd pre-release single for her game-changing album 'ALPHA'!<br /><br />Today I'm reacting to CL's 'Lover Like Me' music video and give my honest thoughts and first impressions on CL's second pre-release single for her upcoming studio album 'ALPHA'.<br /><br />I was lowkey expecting this to not be as badass and &quot;spicy&quot; as her last track 'SPICY', and I was right. This is a more chill R&amp;B based vibe with a super interesting, almost reminding me of EDM, type of instrumental chorus and an extended rap bridge that is quite non-aggressive for CL's usual rapping style. It blends in well with the rest of the song and works great as a bridge and break to it.<br /><br />The sample (if it is one?) singing &quot;Lover Like Me&quot; in the background is also really cool, it sets the tone for the song early on and returns in the chorus. If that's not a sample it could also just be CL herself with a very distorted voice.<br /><br />Also.. am I tripping or is the entire song, bar the rap bridge, fully in English? I think it is and if that's the case I did not even notice that up until the rap began. Which is really good, she made me not care about that and feel like it's just another song with Korean and English lyrics both in there. But no, it seems be a full English song (again, bar the rap bridge). That's sweet!<br /><br />Now with 'SPICY' and 'Lover Like Me' down, I wonder if we will get another and one final pre-release single before the album finally comes out in about 4 weeks time from now or if that's just gonna be it now? 4 weeks of wait without a new song is maybe a bit long, considering she already had two pre-release singles to create hype. But we'll see!<br /><br />💞 Thank you for watching! 💞 If you enjoyed my reaction, subscribe for daily Kpop Reactions and more Asia related content!<br />💎「Patreon」» <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/cru3l_tmo">https://www.patreon.com/cru3l_tmo</a><br /><br />📬 Send me suggestions in the comments what I should react to or review next :)<br /><br />📌 SOCIAL MEDIA 📌<br />============================<br />🏮「Website」» <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cru3ltmo.com">https://cru3ltmo.com</a><br />🏮「Discord」» <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/XGVZaXT">https://discord.gg/XGVZaXT</a><br />🏮「Twitter」» <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/cru3l_tmo">https://twitter.com/cru3l_tmo</a><br />🏮「Instagram」» <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/cru3l_tmo/">https://www.instagram.com/cru3l_tmo/</a><br />🏮「Spotify」» <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/user/11174846556?si=ZEurOW29Q9-8j2XrdvN3Uw">https://open.spotify.com/user/11174846556?si=ZEurOW29Q9-8j2XrdvN3Uw</a><br />🏮「Last.fm」» <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.last.fm/user/xNeliel">https://www.last.fm/user/xNeliel</a><br />🏮「Mydramalist」» <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mydramalist.com/profile/Neliel">https://mydramalist.com/profile/Neliel</a><br />============================<br /><br />0:00 Intro<br />1:10 Reaction<br />7:31 Analysis &amp; After Thoughts<br /><br />Watch the original video here → <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoqA-th1ZPE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoqA-th1ZPE</a><br /><br />============================<br /><br />#ALPHA #LOVERLIKEME #CLLOVERLIKEME{% endraw %}
