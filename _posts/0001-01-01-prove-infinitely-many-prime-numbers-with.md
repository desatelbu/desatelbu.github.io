Then use logical steps to show that this assumption leads to something impossible (either a contradiction of the assumption, or a contradiction of a fact). Then you can conclude that the assumption was wrong, and so the original statement was true.<br />NEXT: Mock Test<br />Prove each of the following by contradiction<br />Q1. There are infinite prime numbers<br />Q2. There are no positive integer solutions to the equation x^2-y^2=1<br />Q3. There is no integer to the equation 8x+6y=1<br />Q4. If n^2 is even integer then n is also an even integer<br />Q5. âˆš2 is irrational number.<br />Q6. Tangent to a circle is at right angle to the{% endraw %}
