{% raw %}See how skylights, hidden storage and a breezy color palette transform this kitchen! Designer Linda Mazur wanted to create a bright and welcoming space for the homeowners, so she added large windows looking out onto a spectacular backyard view. Greige cabinets, rich wooden accents and a spacious island are warm and inviting — perfect for guests and family to enjoy their breakfast. The quartz countertops and backsplash add subtle sparkle with natural light washing in from the skylights and windows.
