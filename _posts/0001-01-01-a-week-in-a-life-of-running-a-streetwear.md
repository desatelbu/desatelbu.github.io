{% raw %}In this episode I will walk you through what's currently is happening in my world. We recently moved to Los Angeles to pursue our Clothing Brand. I'll share my process on how I prepare for a drop for my clothing brand, screen printing some of the pieces in house while exploring new production facilities around downtown LA. I shot a look book and why I use film photography for my brand imagery. Again, this is my process, I am constantly learning and looking for new ways to broaden my horizon. Leave any input in the comments and Let's connect on Instagram <br /><br />Hope you Enjoy ðŸ˜Š <br /><br />To support the brand, shop our website and follow us on socials.<br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://unfinishedlegacy.co/">https://unfinishedlegacy.co/</a><br /><br />Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/ncFJzzdUA9">https://discord.gg/ncFJzzdUA9</a><br /><br />Follow IG: <br />personal: @optic.legacy <br />brand: @unfinishedlegacy<br /><br />Team<br />@solocreator470<br />@djthejenius <br />@mike.esiobu{% endraw %}
