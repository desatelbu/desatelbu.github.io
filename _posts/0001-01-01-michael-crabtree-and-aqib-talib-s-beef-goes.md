{% raw %}You ever find yourself so upset with a colleague that you just don’t how to react? Whether it’s small things like heating up leftover Tilapia that makes the whole office smell like a fish market or catching a person walking out of the bathroom without washing their hands. These types of small annoyances can get under your skin. For Aqib Talib, when it came to competing on the field, he hated looking at Michael Crabtree’s gold chain. Talib loathed Crabtree’s necklace so much that he vowed to snatch it right off his neck. Which he did not once but twice.<br /><br />Michael Crabtree and Aqib Talib’s beef is highlighted by these chain snatching incidents but their feud runs much deeper than fighting over jewelry. It’s a beef rooted in trash talk that dates back to their days of high school ball in Texas, that carried over to their time spent in the Big 12 conference in college, and finally reached its boiling point in the NFL. While the chain was the breaking point between these two, this beef truly has some history.<br /><br />Written, produced and edited by: Joe Ali <br />Motion graphics designed by: Michael Das<br /><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/Nbabae">http://goo.gl/Nbabae</a><br /><br />Enter the Secret Base: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.sbnation.com/secret-base">http://www.sbnation.com/secret-base</a><br />Follow us on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/secretbase">https://twitter.com/secretbase</a><br />Check out our full video catalog: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/9pMHRV">http://goo.gl/9pMHRV</a><br />Visit our playlists: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/NvpZFF">http://goo.gl/NvpZFF</a><br />Explore SB Nation: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.sbnation.com">http://www.sbnation.com</a>{% endraw %}
