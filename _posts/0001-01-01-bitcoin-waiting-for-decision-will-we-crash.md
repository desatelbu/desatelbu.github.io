ETH/BTC pair looks good at first glance, but we can't seem to find enough strenght to fully break through. <br /><br />Video DAY1 : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQHJ3XYcosk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQHJ3XYcosk</a><br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />‚≠ê 24 days of #500KCMGIVEAWAY! ‚≠ê<br /><br />How to be eligible?<br />- Fill the Google form ‚û°Ô∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://forms.gle/R4YLQk83QJg9CM747">https://forms.gle/R4YLQk83QJg9CM747</a> ‚¨ÖÔ∏è<br />- Follow @CryptoMichNL and @eight_global on Twitter<br /><br />How to enter?<br />Starting from the 1st to the 24th of December, this account @CryptoMichNL will announce the prize of the day at 8:00 CET.
