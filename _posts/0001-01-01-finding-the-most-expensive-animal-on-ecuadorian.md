{% raw %}In this episode I am riding to a tiny town called Angamarca. But not before I visit the weekly Andean market close to Saquisili where people come from far to buy and sell their produce. I'm intrigued with the prices for the animals but eventually, the screaming of the pigs force me to leave the market..<br /><br />Gear &amp; Equipment that I use in this season: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.itchyboots.com/blog/gear-and-equipment-season-6-alaska">https://www.itchyboots.com/blog/gear-and-equipment-season-6-alaska</a><br /><br />Follow my journey on: WWW.ITCHYBOOTS.COM<br />Instagram:   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/itchybootstravel">https://www.instagram.com/itchybootstravel</a><br />Facebook:     <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/itchyboots">https://www.facebook.com/itchyboots</a><br /><br /><br />#itchyboots #adventure #crf300rally{% endraw %}
