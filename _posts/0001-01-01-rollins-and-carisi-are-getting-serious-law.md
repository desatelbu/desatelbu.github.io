Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) is a seasoned veteran of the unit who has seen it all. She leads with empathy and professionalism, all the while dealing with her difficult past as a product of rape and her responsibility as a trailblazer in survivor advocacy, both of which influence the way she relates to the victims and perpetrators of each case. Olivia Benson is the longest-running female character in a primetime live action television series.<br /><br />Rollins and Carisi Are Getting Serious | Law &amp; Order: SVU<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/UMMKXEWaxvk">https://youtu.be/UMMKXEWaxvk</a><br /><br />Law &amp; Order<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://youtube.com/c/lawandorder">http://youtube.com/c/lawandorder</a>{% endraw %}
