{% raw %}Patty Smith &amp; Don Henley - Sometimes Love Just Ain't Enough Lyrics Terjemahan Indonesia<br /><br /><br />Now, I don't want to lose you<br />But I don't want to use you<br />Just to have somebody by my side<br />And I don't want to hate you<br />I don't want to take you<br />But I don't want to be the one to cry<br /><br />And that don't really matter<br />To anyone anymore<br />But like a fool I keep losing my place<br />And I keep seeing you walk through that door<br /><br />But there's a danger in loving somebody too much<br />And it's sad when you know it's your heart you can't trust<br />There's a reason why people don't stay where they are<br />Baby, sometimes love just ain't enough<br /><br />Now, I could never change you<br />I don't want to blame you<br />Baby, you don't have to take the fall<br />Yes, I may have hurt you<br />But I did not desert you<br />Maybe I just want to have it all<br /><br />It makes a sound like thunder<br />It makes me feel like rain<br />And like a fool who will never see the truth<br />I keep thinking something's gonna change<br /><br />But there's a danger in loving somebody too much<br />And it's sad when you know it's your heart you can't trust<br />There's a reason why people don't stay where they are<br />Baby, sometimes love just ain't enough<br /><br />And there's no way home<br />When it's late at night and you're all alone<br />Are there things that you wanted to say<br />And do you feel me beside you in your bed<br />There beside you where I used to lay<br /><br />And there's a danger in loving somebody too much<br />And it's sad when you know it's your heart they can't touch<br />There's a reason why people don't stay who they are<br />Baby, sometimes love just ain't enough<br />Baby, sometimes love, it just ain't enough<br /><br /><br />Writer(s): Burtnick Glenn, Smyth Patty{% endraw %}
