{% raw %}Out hiking 4 days with the Lavvu shelter half. Last night was really cold and had to wake up and redo the hot water bottle in sleeping bag thing twice. Time to change sleeping bag ;). Really nice to do a bit longer hike after all the canoeing..haven't done some real tramping since forever. The mountain pack from Norway held up really good in combo with a rain cover. It's compact and sturdy. Really beneficial when the terrain is hard. And I don't know if its just me being crazy for vintage military gear... It's eye candy‚ù§Ô∏è. I have nothing to say about my beloved polish lavvu... other than: it never fails. Year after year. Untreated piece of canvas. Heck... let's put in my will to be wrapped and buried in it when the day comesüòÑ. Yes, cutlery is something I have lost a lot in the wild. That is why I initially started to make videos here carving forks etc. I never lost a ferro rod. And no knife I can remember right now. But a lot of sporks in all valors. I have to find some new system for it. Thanks for watching. <br /><br />..about the snow. Wait for it.<br /><br />gear list: Norwegian mountain pack, Hultafors √Öby axe, mora 120, mora Kansbol, Biltema kettle, vintage US acme pan,  light my fire army fire steel 2.0, Carinthia tropen bag (way to cold for it), DD magic carpet, Thermarest neo air xtherm sleeping pad. Fj√§llr√§ven singi jacket. Lundhags vandra high boots.{% endraw %}
