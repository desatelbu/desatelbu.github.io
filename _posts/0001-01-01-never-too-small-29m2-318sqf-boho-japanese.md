Central to the design concept is the cocoon-like sleeping pod. Enclosed in a series of lightweight translucent polycarbonate screens influenced by Japanese shoji screens, which define space but also can be opened and moved flexibly.. At night with the lights on and screens closed, the pod’s design creates a warm, cozy glow. The remainder of the apartment feels surprisingly spacious, with a full size kitchen and dining space, whilst the living room is purposely void of any fixed furniture, to allow flexibility.. The use of two key materials through-out the space, birch plywood and clay works plaster, unify the space and have a natural patina that brings a warmth to the home. <br /><br />#smallapartment #architecture #interiordesign <br /><br />Music: Found by Kevin Graham<br /><br />Produced by New Mac Video Agency<br />Creator: Colin Chee<br />Director: Nam Tran<br />Cinematographer: Oliver Wilson<br />Producer: Lindsay Barnard<br />Editor: Jessica Ruasol{% endraw %}
