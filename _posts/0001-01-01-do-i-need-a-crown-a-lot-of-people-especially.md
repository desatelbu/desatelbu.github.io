{% raw %}A lot of people, especially patients of mine, ask about crowns and whether it's worth it. A crown is like a safety helmet. It protects the tooth for further damage. Read my article about crowns here <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://askthedent.ist/crowns">https://askthedent.ist/crowns</a><br /><br />Having a root canal done on your tooth is the main reason for needing a crown. To know more about root canals, check my article here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://askthedent.ist/root-canals">https://askthedent.ist/root-canals</a><br /><br />Tooth trauma is also one of the main reasons for needing crowns. Grinding and clenching cause so much trauma to the teeth and our teeth cannot handle so much pressure. What's worse is grinding at night is a symptom of sleep apnea. Read about grinding and sleep apnea here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://askthedent.ist/grinding">https://askthedent.ist/grinding</a><br /><br />The best way to avoid the expense of getting crowns is going back to basics, taking care of your teeth. Biofilm management (brushing and flossing), the right diet and supplementing with vitamins are what I always recommend.<br /><br />Here are some of the products that I personally use.<br /><br />FOR BIOFILM MANAGEMENT:<br />Boka Ela Mint Toothpaste: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://askthedent.ist/boka-toothpaste">https://askthedent.ist/boka-toothpaste</a><br />Boka Mint Floss: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://askthedent.ist/boka-floss">https://askthedent.ist/boka-floss</a><br />Boka Electric Toothbrush: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://askthedent.ist/boka-sonic-brush">https://askthedent.ist/boka-sonic-brush</a><br />Goby Electric Toothbrushes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://askthedent.ist/goby-sonic">https://askthedent.ist/goby-sonic</a><br /><br />SUPPLEMENTS:<br />View our collection of vitamins and supplements to support oral health at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://askthedent.ist/vitamins">https://askthedent.ist/vitamins</a><br /><br />FOOD SOURCES OF VITAMIN K2 (the most important vitamin to support oral health):<br />Visit the Butcherbox site using the link below to get free bacon  + $15 off on your first order.
