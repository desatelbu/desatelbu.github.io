The result was just this: they found that investing $1 in the market, increases the aggregate market value by $5…not 1 CENT, like the average person thought. <br /><br />The purpose was to help explain stock market volatility, find the root cause of rising prices, and estimate the impact of Fed Money Printing within the economy…and, when we have a ratio of 5-to-1…that means that, while companies have a record amount of cash on the sidelines…the stock market could continue going much, much higher. <br /><br />Obviously, nobody can predict what’s going to unfold in the short term…and, ANYTHING could happen…but, still…study after study continues to show the same thing: if you have cash, it’s better to invest all of it immediately, than wait to invest….75% of the time. <br /><br />As for myself…I’ve employed a little bit of a hybrid approach, where - I keep some cash on the sidelines as my “opportunity” fund in case a good investment comes up…but, with everything else… every single day…without fail…I invest a consistent amount in the market, and that’s it. <br /><br />But, like I mentioned…statistically..it does seem like, the more likely investors are worried about a crash…the less likely there is a crash…unless, by doing the opposite…we actually wind up seeing a crash…because, we didn’t think there would be one, because people thought one would happen…<br /><br />My ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB">https://www.amazon.com/shop/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB</a><br /><br />For business or one-on-one real estate investing/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com<br /><br />*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.
