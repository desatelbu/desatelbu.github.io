{% raw %}This is it folks the final episode of Talking Sopranos….and what better guest than David Chase to wrap it all up. Michael Imperioli and Steve Schirripa ask David a whole list of questions that have come up during the podcast….Is there really anything to the Rhiannon theory? Did Ralphie kill Pie-O-My? Is Tony alive or dead. It’s all in this final episode.
