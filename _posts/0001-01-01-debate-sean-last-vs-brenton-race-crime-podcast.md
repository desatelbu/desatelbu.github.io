In my own academic journey, some academics (though not all) have become closed to controversial people or topics being debated/discussed. Thus, my goal is to provide a non-partisan and truly-tolerant debate platform that welcomes everyone. <br /><br />If this resonates with you personally, consider supporting our neutral platform in one of the following ways:<br /><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/ModernDayDebate">https://www.patreon.com/ModernDayDebate</a><br /><br />PayPal: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/ModernDayDebate">https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/ModernDayDebate</a><br /><br />OR support us by using our Amazon portal link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/modern-daydebate">https://www.amazon.com/shop/modern-daydebate</a> <br /><br />________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />OUR SOCIAL MEDIA<br />Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/moderndaydebate">https://www.twitch.tv/moderndaydebate</a><br />Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/Qp7VtZ2">https://discord.gg/Qp7VtZ2</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/ModernDayDebate">https://twitter.com/ModernDayDebate</a> (@ModernDayDebate)<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/ModernDayDebate">https://www.facebook.com/ModernDayDebate</a><br />______________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />DISCLAIMER The views shared by guests on Modern-Day Debate are not necessarily representative of the views of Modern-Day Debate, James, or any university he has or has had any affiliation with.
