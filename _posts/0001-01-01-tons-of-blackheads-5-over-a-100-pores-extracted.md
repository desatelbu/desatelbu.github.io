{% raw %}This is session #5 for this patient. We started with his milia this time. He’s coming along great, less and less clogged pores each time. His nose has very active oil production leading to copious amounts of keratin build up. As the medications start to do their job he will have less each time until he’s stabilized. Thanks to him for sharing his procedures. He’s a very tough young man, he does not even flinch on some of the big squeezes on the nose. Wait for the nose, the pores are very full. Acne extractions. Blackheads, whiteheads, milia. Q-tips, loop extractor, finger squeezes. Dermatology procedure. Dermatology Physician Assistant. MrPopZit.{% endraw %}
