Then you decide if you're going to do them daily or at the most weekly. Your plan should never include actions that your do any further out than weekly. <br /> <br />The most important part of what does it mean to be consistent is making sure no matter what, you complete those process goals when you say you're going to.<br />  <br />Let say I want to lose 10 pounds within the next 12 weeks.

Doing those daily actions consistently.  You must execute. <br /><br />So what does it mean to be consistent?
