{% raw %}Are you struggling to find good items in Diablo II: Resurrected? In this video, we talk about what to reasonably expect in &quot;getting rich&quot; and what to do with budget builds. We also mention my most-suggested area to farm during the first few days of Ladder Resets or Launch.<br /><br />Intro - 0:00<br />Trading (ABT) - 0:48<br />Be Willing To Do This - 1:12<br />Stay Ahead of the Meta - 1:50<br />Nihlathak &amp; the Red Portal - 3:18<br />Keys of Destruction - 4:05<br />Updated Budget Build (Day 4) - 4:49<br />Farming Halls of Vaught - 6:10<br />Know this for Ladder Reset - 7:26<br /><br />Join my club on ArenaGL to be a part of all our PvP Events:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://arena.gl/clubs/ckfixos6a1524150ul9a8xewx9g">https://arena.gl/clubs/ckfixos6a1524150ul9a8xewx9g</a><br /><br />Twitch.tv/Coooley<br />Twitter @Coooley<br /><br />A little different that MrLlamaSC on How to Get RICH or WithNoFiller on The Way to Get Rich FAST on Diablo 2 Resurrected, but definitely the best character to get rich with in a reasonable way in D2R.
