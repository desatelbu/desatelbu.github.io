I am really passionate about learning, technology, photography, cinematography, reading, hiking, always improving and am studying Computer Engineering at The University of Pretoria (Tuks). These videos are a way of remembering my life and to possibly help out some other future varsity students get a sense of what they're in for.<br /><br />#career #lifeplanning #careeradvice{% endraw %}
