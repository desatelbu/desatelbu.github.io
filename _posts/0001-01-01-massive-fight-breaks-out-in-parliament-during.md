{% raw %}A massive scuffle broke out in Parliament during the vote over the controversial E-Levy. <br /><br />NDC MPs were upset that the First Deputy Speaker, Joseph Osei Owusu, who was sitting in for the Speaker, was about to give up his seat to the Second Deputy Speaker, Andrew Asiamah Amoako, who had already cast his vote. The Minority believed that Mr Osei Owusu wanted to cast a vote as well.  #CitiNewsroom <br /><br />Follow us:<br /><br /><br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/CitiTVGH/">https://www.facebook.com/pg/CitiTVGH/</a><br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/CitiTVGH">https://twitter.com/CitiTVGH</a><br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/cititvgh/">https://www.instagram.com/cititvgh/</a><br /><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://cititvonline.com/">http://cititvonline.com/</a>{% endraw %}
