{% raw %}This past weekend, we at Mastery Hoops hosted the First Annual Player Development Conference in Miami. We were lucky enough to have Paul Fabritz, Devin Williams, Drew Hanlen, Mike G, Tim Martin, Micah Lancaster, Tyler LeClerc, and myself, Coleman Ayers involved to make it an unforgettable experience for all attendees! If you're interested in next year's conference and/or the recording, head here: www.masteryhoops.com/pdc<br /><br />Video work: @SilvaHoops{% endraw %}
