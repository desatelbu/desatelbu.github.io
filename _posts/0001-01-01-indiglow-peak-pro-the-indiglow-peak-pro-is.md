{% raw %}The Indiglow Peak Pro is both subtle and complex. A smooth purple and blue gradient fades over the translucent silicon base and the metal band and then continues upward as it meets the sacred geometry inspired blow molded inner dome and outer cone glass. It also features a limited-edition app only available to Indiglow users.<br />Limited supplies available at Puffco.com{% endraw %}
