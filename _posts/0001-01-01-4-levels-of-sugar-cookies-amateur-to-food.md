{% raw %}We challenged chefs of three different skill levels - amateur Emily, home cook Beth, and professional chef Penny Stankiewicz from The Institute Of Culinary Education - to make us a batch of sugar cookies. Once each level of chef had presented their bakes, we asked expert food scientist Rose to explain the choices each of them made along the way - both good and bad. Which cookie would you sneak out of the kitchen just before bed?<br /><br /><br /><br />Follow chef Penny at @penny.stankiewicz<br /><br />Find Beth at @@bethdimino<br /><br />Follow Emily at @emilyslamduncan<br /><br />Looking for Rose?
