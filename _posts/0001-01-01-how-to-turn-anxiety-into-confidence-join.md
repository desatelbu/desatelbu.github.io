He’ll often slouch or fidget in conversation, doing things you’re quote unquote not supposed to do.<br /><br />But Tom has a few core mindsets you can steal that will instantly make you more confident in almost any social situation.  These mindsets allow him to project a confident “I don’t give a f**k” attitude that draws people to him.<br /><br /><br />⏰TIMESTAMPS⏰ <br /><br />0:00 - Intro<br />0:50 - #1: Be willing to polarize<br />1:35 - #2: Allow yourself to have authentic reactions<br />3:45 - #3: Stop trying to look flawless<br />5:23 - The shadow rule<br />6:47 - #4: Prioritize your own comfort<br />8:38 - Are your fears holding you back?<br />10:49 - Links &amp; more videos<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /> #TomHardy #CharismaOnCommand<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br /><br />Connect with us further:<br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.charismaoncommand.com">http://www.charismaoncommand.com</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/charismaoncommand">http://facebook.com/charismaoncommand</a><br />Instagram: @CharismaOnCommand<br />Or if you want to see our personal stuff:<br />Instagram: @CharlieHoupert<br />Instagram: @IamBenAltman{% endraw %}
