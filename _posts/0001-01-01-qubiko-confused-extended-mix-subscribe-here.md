This record has got a cool, feel-good vibe to it and is the perfect follow up to his last release ‘Ophelia’ with Denis Ago that landed on Toolroom Trax recently.<br /> <br />This all comes off the back of a solid few years of releases across some of the world’s best dance labels, having appeared on Defected, DFTD, Spinnin’ Deep to name a few, Qubiko has been cutting shapes and making waves in the scene now for a minute. If you weren’t in the mood for dancing, then this talented Italian producer is here to get your body moving with that bubbling bass line, chunky drums and stunning vocals littered throughout, ‘Confused’ is a straight up, feel-good House record! Expect to hear this one of those sun-drenched terraces as we head towards the end of Summer.<br /><br />Sign up to the Toolroom Family: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://Toolroom.lnk.to/FamilySignUpTY">https://Toolroom.lnk.to/FamilySignUpTY</a>{% endraw %}
