{% raw %}From Nakura: &quot;I can't believe I had forgotten about this S3RL song, the original is so good. I was browsing S3RL's remix packs on his website and seeing it available jogged my memory. I remembered really liking it when it was new in 2014. Since I like the original so much, the remix pack was available and I had some ideas for it, I set off on remixing it. I gave it the 2-step beat spin that I have been liking lately, I figured it would work with the melody and I was right. I really like the sound I was able to give to the song and I want to try remixing more S3RL stuff in the near future.&quot;<br /><br />Another one of my all time favourite songs!<br /><br />Nakura: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/audiovitamin">https://www.patreon.com/audiovitamin</a><br />Icywhisker: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/icywhisker">https://www.youtube.com/c/icywhisker</a><br />My Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/ZGc8KYY">https://discord.gg/ZGc8KYY</a><br />More S3RL: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/UxVwAvr">https://discord.gg/UxVwAvr</a><br />My S3RL Tracklist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11iJXw3gc5Z_u-HfTqlup_vByXNlYICt8rnnC56PWzPU/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/11iJXw3gc5Z_u-HfTqlup_vByXNlYICt8rnnC56PWzPU/edit?usp=sharing</a><br />Image artist: - I was unable to locate the original artist for the image in this video, if you have evidence or proof of the correct artist or are the artist in question, please email me at icywhisker@gmail.com and I will credit you as necessary.
