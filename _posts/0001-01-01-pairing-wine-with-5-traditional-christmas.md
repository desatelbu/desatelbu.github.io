{% raw %}Although Christmas traditions differ all around the world, usually the food served during the Christmas dinner is hearty and flavorsome, and most of these dishes can be paired beautifully with wine. In this video I will look at wine pairings for Christmas dishes that are traditional in my region, which is Baltic and Nordic countries, but most of these foods in different variations are served during Christmas all around the world.<br /><br />Whether it is a roasted turkey or some sweet snack, such as gingerbread cookie, I got you covered. Fatty, lean, spicy or sweet â€“ there is always a good wine pairing for Christmas dishes.<br /><br />You may also be interested in my other videos on food and wine pairing:<br />How to pair WINE with PIZZA: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/Xy3ASVV-yW0">https://youtu.be/Xy3ASVV-yW0</a><br />5 Difficult Foods to Pair With Wine (And How to Overcome That): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/3olx0XDcTSA">https://youtu.be/3olx0XDcTSA</a><br /><br />Be sure to subscribe to my channel, as I am posting weekly videos all about wine.<br /><br />**FOLLOW ME:<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/blancdenoir/">https://www.instagram.com/blancdenoir/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/blancdenoir">https://twitter.com/blancdenoir</a><br /><br />Free Realistic Snow Overlay by Kosmos Motion Graphics <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://youtu.be/vEhD5WwCo44">http://youtu.be/vEhD5WwCo44</a>{% endraw %}
