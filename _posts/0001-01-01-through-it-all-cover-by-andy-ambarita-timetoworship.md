{% raw %}#Timetoworship <br /><br />Well this song has been on my heart to share with you all. Every time I hear or sing this song it reminds me of my LDR days with Acha. I found comfort knowing the Lord was with us &quot;through it all&quot;. To be honest, it was a challenging season that brought discomfort and anxiety. But, through it all, because of that season, and all its calamities, it has stretched us and increased our capacities and had made us wiser through the process. <br /><br />I believe, God will not pour out a large blessing into a small cup, so because of that these processes are set out to increase our capacity to receive are bigger blessing in a variety things of things. But first we must learn the lesson &quot;in the middle&quot; of the process.<br /><br />I don't know specifically what you are going through right now, or what you will go through. But what I know is God wants to increase capacities through this ugly thing called process. But take heart we have a God who is faithful and just. He's name is Jesus, and Jesus has gone before us. <br /><br />Some one once said, If we are not ready, we could potentially destroy something great, or something great could potentially destroy us. <br /><br /><br />Through its all - Hillsong (Darlene Zschech){% endraw %}
