{% raw %}Joby Aviation's electric, six rotor aircraft can take off like a helicopter yet fly like a plane. Its commercial operations, which it hopes to launch by 2024, will allow customers to book a seat on one of its aircraft like they would on a rideshare app. With a distance of up to 150 miles on a single charge and four-passenger capacity, Joby hopes that its aircraft can help relieve urban congestion.<br /><br />Produced by John General<br />Senior Producer: Jackson Loo<br /><br />#CNN<br />#Aviation<br />#eVTOL{% endraw %}
