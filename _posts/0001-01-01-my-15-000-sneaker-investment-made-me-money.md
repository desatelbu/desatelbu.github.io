We bought into these shoes at $290-300 and sold at $360 each. We even share some sneaker reselling advice / tips on how to make money selling shoes, clothes, and content. We show you real deals and cashouts in our sneaker store and the interactions with our customers and fans. We also talk about our past investment advice on sneakers like the Jordan 4 Oreo, Jordan 4 Fire Red, Jordan 4 University Blue, Jordan 1 Low Neutral Grey, Nike Dunk Low Black/White, and other shoes we have called to buy to make money reselling sneakers. We show you many sneaker unboxings in this video, which also feel like sneaker mystery boxes to us sometimes. We are starting a twitch stream, so make sure to go follow us on that platform! We also share that we will be at Sneaker con Atlanta in a few weeks from today. Based on how Sneakercon Denver, Sneakercon Dallas, Sneakercon Chicago, and Sneaker con San Jose / Bay Area went, Altlanta will be a BANGER. You may find our videos similar to that of Cam's Kicks and Sneak City. We hope you all enjoy the videos and thank you for the continued support!<br /><br />If you guys are in the Phoenix, Chandler, Gilbert, Mesa, Tempe or Scottsdale area in Arizona, come check out our shop located in Tempe!<br /><br />Help me hit 20K followers on Instagram<br />IG: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/thecommonhype/">https://www.instagram.com/thecommonhype/</a><br />Store IG: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/commonhypeaz/">https://www.instagram.com/commonhypeaz/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/thecommonhype">https://twitter.com/thecommonhype</a><br />Cook Group: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/thegoodchefs/">https://www.instagram.com/thegoodchefs/</a><br /><br />Music By: Valious and Depo on the Beat{% endraw %}
