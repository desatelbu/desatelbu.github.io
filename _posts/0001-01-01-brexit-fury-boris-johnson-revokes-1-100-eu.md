{% raw %}Thanks for watching my videos among the countless videos out there!<br />Don't forget to subscribe to my channel!<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------<br />Brexit fury: Boris revokes 1,100 EU fishing permits 'undermining' fisheries.<br />BRITAIN revokes more than 1,100 EU ship permits issued after Brexit. A conservation agency says &quot;destructive&quot; fishing practices cannot be outlawed in the UK.<br />These permits came into effect at the beginning of this year after the UK left the EU. “This goes against the Habitat Regulations and the Marine Acts and could make them illegal under UK law,” Oceana said.<br />Melissa Moore, UK head of policy at Oceana, has called on the Government to use its powers to act.<br />“We need an immediate ban on fishing and dredging in all Marine Protected Areas offshore as well as inshore as required by UK law,” she said. “If we don't do it now, when are we going to do it? In 10 years? 20 years time? Every day we leave it, or every year we leave it, we are drawing closer to the abyss.”<br />✅To watch more videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/misslacibug/videos">https://www.youtube.com/user/misslacibug/videos</a><br />✅Follow me on:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Ukyounews/?ref=page_internal">https://www.facebook.com/Ukyounews/?ref=page_internal</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/DailyBeast6">https://twitter.com/DailyBeast6</a><br />✅Contact us: UKyounews1@gmail.com<br />Have a nice day!<br />#UKYouNews1{% endraw %}
