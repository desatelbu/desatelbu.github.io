{% raw %}Spread throughout the planet, there are countless structures, buildings, or cities that remain as memories of a time long ago. These ancient structures have been shrouded in mystery, and we often cannot even decipher who created them all those years ago. This has led to so many theories and myths, but given how limited our knowledge is, it's possible we may never know how these buildings were created. <br /><br />#TheUnknownList{% endraw %}
