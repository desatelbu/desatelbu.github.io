{% raw %}Our RUS team is steadfast in combing cut off places where jiggers pose a danger to people, and those who can help don't access. We're stopping at nothing until the jigger is no more. This war requires each one of us join hands with us. Let's unite and keep killing the jigger.<br /><br />In this video you are seeing the Jigger, a parasitic sand flea, being removed from human skin.   Viewer discretion is advised! <br /><br />This YouTube video is intended to educate and raise awareness about the flea problem in Africa.<br /><br />Proverbs 19:17 Kindness to the poor is a loan to the LORD<br /><br /><br />DONATION INFORMATION:  My PayPal is jimnduruchi@yahoo.com.
