{% raw %}A Toyota Master Diagnostic Technician shares the Best and Worst Used Lexus models to buy. Some of the Worst models will be a surprise to some!<br /><br />In this video we're continuing on Lexus-thon! at the Car Care Nut channel with the best and worst Lexus models to buy per your request and as promised in the previous video!<br /><br />We'll start off with the best middle aged Lexus models to buy. These are models that are out of the factory warranty that I would recommend even without an extended warranty.<br /><br />Then we'll move on to the oldies section where these are older models that are still reliable enough to drive a lot more miles.<br /><br />Then we'll move into the bad Lexus models. Folks this is the truth from experience. To some it will be hard to hear the car that they own be called bad and if you own of those models and it's been good I am very happy, glad and wish it continues to be good.<br /><br />Follow the channel on Social Media :<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/thecarcarenut">http://www.facebook.com/thecarcarenut</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/thecarcarenut">http://www.instagram.com/thecarcarenut</a><br /><br />Check out the channel Merch store<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEKt2bUDBoRUw3wpPpDOUaA/store">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEKt2bUDBoRUw3wpPpDOUaA/store</a><br /><br />Support the channel on Patreon:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.patreon.com/thecarcarenut">http://www.patreon.com/thecarcarenut</a><br /><br />Make a one time donation to the channel:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.paypal.me/CCNdonate">http://www.paypal.me/CCNdonate</a><br /><br />Check out the amazon store:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/shop/thecarcarenut">http://www.amazon.com/shop/thecarcarenut</a><br />*as an Amazon associate, I earn from qualifying purchases.<br /><br />Mailing Address:<br />The Car Care Nut<br />P.O Box 2850<br />Orland Park, IL 60462<br /><br />#thecarcarenut #buyingguide #Lexus<br /><br />0:00 Into<br />0:43 Best Newer Lexus Models to buy<br />6:26 Best Oldies Lexus models to buy<br />10:29 Worst Lexus Models to buy<br />22:25 General Lexus buying advice{% endraw %}
