LOLOL<br />15:52 - I canâ€™t even begin to tell you how many compliments Bennix gets when he wears his jackets, but especially the red and black checkered! <br />21:21 - as statedâ€¦ he has figured out how to stick his head under the lid to look for toysâ€¦ heâ€™s too smart for his own good!<br />22:00 - Lavender loves it more than Bennix does, honestly!<br />22:22 - I ended up finding SO many other cute things I bought him after filming this! Like an ice cream cone that you freeze so they can chew on it and cool down, and a bottle of wine thatâ€™s filled with a crinkle material with a speaker!

I was diagnosed with Retinitis Pigmentosa at just 4 years old and began public speaking at age 5. I started just doing motivational speaking, but now I make videos and even model! Even though I canâ€™t see, I know that there are bright spots in everything we face. Letâ€™s find them together. ðŸ’•{% endraw %}
