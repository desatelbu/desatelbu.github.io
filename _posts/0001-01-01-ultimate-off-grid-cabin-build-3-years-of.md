{% raw %}It's hard to believe that I've been working at the log cabin now for over 3 years. Doing most of the work by myself and doing it the way I envision it takes a lot of time, but I would not want to do it any other way. Here I've put together an overview of the last 3 years, cut into a 30min video. I've done a lot of work to get the cabin to where it is now, with over 50 hours of videos produced and I thought it would be nice to have a shorter video showing everything from start until now. I can imagine that not everyone would like to go through all of the episodes or my longer recaps at the end of the year. Although watching the episodes, gives a completely different understanding of how the building was done and it shows more into the details the process.<br /><br />Thank you for watching!<br /><br />Don't forget to subscribe to not miss the future episodes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/rijavecniksubscribe">http://bit.ly/rijavecniksubscribe</a><br /><br />Log Cabin Building End of the Year Recaps:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/LogCabin2019Recap">http://bit.ly/LogCabin2019Recap</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/LogCabin2020Recap">http://bit.ly/LogCabin2020Recap</a><br /><br />Off Grid Log Cabin Playlist:<br />Season 1: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/offgridlogcabin">https://bit.ly/offgridlogcabin</a><br />Season 2: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/offgridlogcabins2">https://bit.ly/offgridlogcabins2</a><br />Season 3: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/offgridlogcabins3">https://bit.ly/offgridlogcabins3</a><br /><br />Edited by: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/LeoGamboc">https://bit.ly/LeoGamboc</a><br /><br />#nikrijavec #logcabin #offgrid #cabinbuild{% endraw %}
