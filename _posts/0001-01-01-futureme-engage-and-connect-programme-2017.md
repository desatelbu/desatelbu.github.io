{% raw %}The aims of the programme with grade 9-12 learners were to…<br />- Assist learners with ‘engaging and connecting’ with professionals from a broad spectrum of careers<br />- Create excitement around opportunities post school<br />- Open the learners’ eyes to an array of exciting careers<br />  <br />Our research shows that young people find it truly inspiring to hear first-hand what different careers offer and what it takes to be successful in their chosen career.  <br />That is why we ran our first ever Engage and Connect Programme at Christel House High School in September 2017.<br />It was a great success and learners loved interacting with the speakers from an array of careers!{% endraw %}
