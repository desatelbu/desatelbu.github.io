{% raw %}We now can understand the pyramids and Stonehenge. Jesus tells us the demonic world has Mecca in the desert wilderness as its central location. This means the god of Mecca cannot be the true God.  Listen to Jesus.  Knowing this, we can now understand why celestial orientation of various ancient demonic worship structures and idolatrous wonders around the world align towards Mecca.  They are oriented towards the city which Revelation says is “a haunt for every impure spirit”, “a haunt for every unclean bird” (Revelation 18:2).  This means the stories about Jesus from the god in Mecca are not true.{% endraw %}
