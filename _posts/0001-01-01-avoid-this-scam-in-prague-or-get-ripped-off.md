{% raw %}#pragueminimarket #Praguescam #touristtrap <br />if you are traveling to Prague, it's important to avoid these minimarts or minimarket that sell everything at 3 to 4 times the normal price to tourists and if you are local you get a different price to tourists. I filmed a tourist trap and a normal market so you can see the differences.{% endraw %}
