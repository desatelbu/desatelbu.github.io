{% raw %}A DC Gear motor is a motor that converts direct current electrical power into mechanical power. The DC motor is generally composed of two parts: a stator and a rotor. While the stator consists of the main magnetic pole, the frame, reversing pole, and the brush device, the rotor is made up of armature core, armature winding, commutator, shaft, and fan, etc. The working principle of the DC motor is based on the principle that when a current-carrying conductor is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a mechanical force.<br />There will be two magnetic fields. One field is produced by the main magnetic poles; the other field is produced by an electrical current flowing in the motor winding. These two fields result in a torque which tends to rotate the rotor. As the rotor turns, the current in the winding is commutated to produce a continuous torque output.<br />The DC Gear Motor with a size of 24mm are widely used in many fields such as model aircraft, medical equipment, household appliances, electric vehicles, etc. Besides selling standard products, ZHAOWEI can provide design, research and manufacture for customers based on their specific needs as well.
