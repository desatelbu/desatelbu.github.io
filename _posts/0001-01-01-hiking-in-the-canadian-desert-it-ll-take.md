{% raw %}Ive done this hike many many times and it NEVER gets old.  This is actually the largest sand dune in British Columbia and it is the softest sand you will ever feel. The funnest part this time, is that someone left a snowboard at the dune and it actually worked to ride down.  I had a couple nice runs down the dune, and maybe a couple of crashes as well.<br /><br />To support this channel, consider joining the Destination adventure Patreon team.  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/DestinationAdventure/membership">https://www.patreon.com/DestinationAdventure/membership</a>{% endraw %}
