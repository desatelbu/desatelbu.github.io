Simply put, itâ€™s what someone thinks will happen in the future.<br />Itâ€™s impossible to guarantee accurate information about the future but one can always have a guess or estimation of what the future scenarios may be. <br />That way, you can surface out options and plan out possible developments and adjustments as you go.<br />Prediction entails different things in different settings. It is practised in many different industries all the time. <br />Some may be based on scientific calculations but most are just guesses and opinions.<br />For example, weather forecasting is based on science and technology that is used to predict the future conditions of the atmosphere.<br />While you might give your best guess in prediction when you have to let your friend know about your weekend plans.<br />Prediction encourages one to actively think ahead and ask questions based on what they have already heard, read, or seen.<br />It can even improve oneâ€™s critical thinking and problem-solving skills as you process and try to make connections on what you already know.<br />While this may seem trivial, itâ€™s extremely useful on a grander scale like in business and medicine wherein prediction is crucial to success. <br />It can help you rule out possible problems and confidently move forward as youâ€™ve prepared ahead of time.<br />While many situations in our life never fail to remind us how the future is always uncertain, it doesnâ€™t hurt to try to predict what the future holds for us.<br /><br />I hope that you enjoyed this video and I was able to give you a quick summary of what Prediction is and why it is useful.   ________________<br /><br />Hi, My name is Janis and Iâ€™m Content Creator and Entrepreneur.<br /><br />One thing that Iâ€™m really passionate about is Time Management.
