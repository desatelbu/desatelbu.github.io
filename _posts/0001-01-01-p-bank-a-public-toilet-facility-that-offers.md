{% raw %}During her talk on the Antenna 2019 stage, Anniek Vetter explained that at the centre of her project with team member, Sylvia Debit is the chemical element, phosphorus, which is currently endangered due to high consumption levels. <br /><br />“Phosphor is mined at the time still in mines, but they are almost exhausted. Alternative Phosphorus sources are required for the future,” explains Vetter. <br /><br />Vetter explains P Bank as a facility that allows visitors to make a P donation. While donating, one learns about the upcoming phosphorus scarcity and as a result, be part of the solution. With this, they are able to use the urine to grow plants as this has become a substitute for fertilizer.<br /><br />“With each visit, you spend about 300 ml of urine. This contains about 200 mg Phosphor. That's enough to grow 4 carrots,” she explains <br /><br />In 2016 and 2017 the P bank team was selected for the Neudeli incubator programme and was sponsored by the B100 Bauhaus anniversary fund. This year it received funding from the German Federal Environmental Foundation (DBU).<br /><br />Design Indaba | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://inda.ba/mIWuZI">http://inda.ba/mIWuZI</a> <br />Facebook | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://inda.ba/1g1hse0">http://inda.ba/1g1hse0</a> <br />Twitter | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://inda.ba/1ouKlDq">http://inda.ba/1ouKlDq</a> <br />Instagram | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://inda.ba/1QRVKhn">http://inda.ba/1QRVKhn</a> <br />Linkedin | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://inda.ba/3eZfEqi">https://inda.ba/3eZfEqi</a><br />Newsletter | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://inda.ba/TwaPdH">http://inda.ba/TwaPdH</a>{% endraw %}
