BMW 750i vs Porsche Panamera Turbo + Tuned RS6 C7 Bonus.<br />Cars with Pilot<br />Ladies and Getlemen, this is your pilot speaking, my name is Tseno and here we are with another drag race just for you! This is between some of best german luxury limousines on the market. The Porsche Panamera turbo with its 550hp against new facelifted 2020 BMW 750i with the updated 4.4 Liter V8 with 530hp.

Click and my team and I will help you choose your ideal car at a fair price - from Mat Watson! ............................................................. Introducing the all-new BMW M4! Thatâ€™s right, Matâ€™s finally got his hands on the new M4 Competition! We know certain elements (ðŸ‘€) of the M4â€™s design may not be to everyoneâ€™s taste, but does the new M4 offer enough changes elsewhere to help you overlook them? Well with it being a BMW M, we need to start with performanceâ€¦ And we can assure you that the new M3 &amp; M4 do NOT disappoint! With a 3-litre straight-six turbo, they can put down a whopping 510hp and 650Nm, while it can easily shoot you to 60mph in under 4 seconds! But of course, we know youâ€™re probably still not happy with that new grille. But letâ€™s be honest, given it was announced so long ago, arenâ€™t we all kind of used to it now? Or are you still so disappointed you canâ€™t bear to look yet? So what do you think? The performance is exactly the same as the new BMW M3 Competition, but would you choose the coupe M4 over the saloon M3? Let us know in the comments!
