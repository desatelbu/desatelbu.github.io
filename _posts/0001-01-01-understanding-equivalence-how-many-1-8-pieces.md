{% raw %}This video demonstrates how students can practice finding equivalent fractions with different denominators using fraction tiles. Students can explore this concept by stacking fraction tiles to determine the multiple representations of the same value, such as 1/2.  Once students have found one representation of the same fraction (4/8), teachers can encourage students to find another representation (3/6). Teachers can then ask students to discuss the patterns that they see in the different representations of the same value.{% endraw %}
