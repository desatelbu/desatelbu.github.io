{% raw %}Service is a problem in this industry and by far the biggest department at Yale.  <br /><br />Other stores may tell you not to worry about it, but we logged over 37,000 service calls last year alone, and that’s just in the Boston area. <br /><br />In this video you will finally learn about the most reliable brands (Sub-Zero, KitchenAid, Bosch, Wolf, Samsung, Miele, Beko/Blomberg, LG, Whirlpool, and GE) and appliances based on those 37,061 service calls logged. <br /><br />You will see each brand’s service rate by percentage, best attributes and their most common problems. <br /><br /> In some cases, you should also not buy or consider the most reliable brands on this list depending on where you live.  <br /><br />The most reliable brands typically sell more reliable categories, like laundry and more basic, builder-grade appliances. However, there are some exceptions for better and even premium brands. <br /><br />Some of the best brands on this list have little support available when there is an issue. So, you want to buy a reliable brand, but also find the best support. <br /><br />---------<br /><br />Interested in learning more?<br /><br />Download our FREE Appliance Buying Guide with honest reviews of all the most popular brands and updates on new tech and trends. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://blog.yaleappliance.com/free-appliance-buying-guide">https://blog.yaleappliance.com/free-appliance-buying-guide</a><br /><br />Learning Center:<br /><br />Visit our Learning Center, home to all our most popular videos, articles, and buying guides about all things in the appliance world.  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://blog.yaleappliance.com/resource-center">https://blog.yaleappliance.com/resource-center</a><br /><br />Yale Appliance:<br /><br />Browse hundreds of in-stock products from the most popular appliance brands. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.yaleappliance.com/">https://www.yaleappliance.com/</a><br /><br />If you liked this video, don't forget to LIKE and SUBSCRIBE.
