{% raw %}The European Union is to step up sanctions against Belarus in response to an escalating migrant crisis on the border with Poland.<br /><br />Top EU diplomat Josep Borrell confirmed the move, saying that vulnerable migrants were being exploited in a &quot;hybrid war&quot; that is &quot;intensifying&quot;.<br /><br />Belarus is accused of pushing migrants towards its borders to undermine security, a charge it denies.<br /><br />On Monday, hundreds of migrants were blocked at a crossing by Polish troops.<br /><br />A video filmed at the border by the BBC showed migrants sitting down on a road in front of barbed wire and Polish forces in a tense stand-off.<br /><br />Those migrants came from a large makeshift camp at the Kuznica crossing, where thousands have settled in tents just inside Belarus.<br /><br />&quot;Goodbye!&quot; called out a smiling girl, flashing a peace sign as she, and hundreds more, streamed towards the border, hoping to get through.<br /><br />But they are trapped between Polish guards on one side and Belarusian guards on the other. The migrants cannot get into Poland, but are also being prevented from retreating back into Belarus, according to Polish authorities.<br /><br />Please subscribe HERE <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1rbfUog">http://bit.ly/1rbfUog</a><br /><br />#BBCNews #Belarus #Poland{% endraw %}
