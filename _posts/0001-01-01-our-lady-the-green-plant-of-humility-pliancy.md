{% raw %}Near the beginning of the Scriptures, in the first chapter of Genesis, we read: “Let the earth put forth the green plant that will send forth seed and the fruit-bearing tree that yields fruit” (1:11). With the help of St. Thomas Aquinas, let us take these words for our meditation today on the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary. In Ecclesiasticus we read, “The Most High has created a medicine from the earth” (38:4). According to Genesis, this medicine is two-fold… the green plant and the fruit-bearing tree. The green plant is Our Lady… and the tree is the Cross… from which she picks the fruit of salvation for us. If we ponder upon plants we can see that they are (i) short in height as compared to trees, (ii) pliant or flexible, and (iii) a source of health and strength for man. Let us consider these things. Our Lady is the green plant… humble, pliant to God’s graces, and full of health and medicine to all that ails man. If someone is ailing, let him seek this green plant.
