I'm originally from Iran, but I live and work in the UK. I love languages and speak English, French, Persian, some Spanish, and a little bit of German too.<br /><br />I obtained my Cambridge DELTA qualification to become an English language teacher and teacher trainer in the UK in 1985. In 1987, I moved to Belgium, where I taught English to adults and directed a residential programme for 15 years. In 2002, I returned to the UK to set up my own one-to-one English immersion courses.<br /><br />In 2008, I started the Anglo-Link website, which is now a complete online self-study English course with several thousand members. You can explore my course at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://anglo-link.com.">https://anglo-link.com.</a><br /><br />I launched Anglo-Link's YouTube channel in 2011, and I am very grateful to all of you for your  wonderful comments and encouragement. It is your tremendous support that is motivating me to continue creating more quality lessons both on YT and for my online course. <br /><br />I wish you all a lot of success with your English studies!{% endraw %}
