{% raw %}If I had to pick one Christmas song to learn on guitar it would be Fairytale Of New York by The Pogues so that is why I have made this lesson as my first Xmas video which includes that beautiful piano intro transcribed to guitar along with all the other sections. This is a fast paced song with lots of strumming so it is an excellent one to work on if you are improving technique.<br /><br />Thanks for watching!<br /><br />Tony<br /><br />If you like this video then check out my 6 tips for open chord embellishments<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2WQxWm79kA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2WQxWm79kA</a><br /><br />And my tips for jamming and playing by ear<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pedT2ynwbxo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pedT2ynwbxo</a><br /><br />To subscribe and see new videos every week<br /><br />ðŸ”´ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJWA7pDKOxX7Mmk7SeD5q-g?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJWA7pDKOxX7Mmk7SeD5q-g?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />If you are on Facebook you should come join our group so you can catch more lessons, upload performance videos and interact with me and other students. <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/783114872614451">https://www.facebook.com/groups/783114872614451</a><br /><br />See guitar-made-easy.com for more completely free lessons and courses - designed to make learning as fun as possible.
