{% raw %}From the highs of Olympic glory, psychologists fear the majority of elite athletes will suffer worrying mental and physical health issues in retirement. <br /><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/abcnewsindepth">https://www.youtube.com/c/abcnewsindepth</a> Read more from here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ab.co/3zw8Tqw">https://ab.co/3zw8Tqw</a><br /><br />Those who have won gold in Tokyo, like Olympians gone by, will be etched into Australian sporting history.<br /><br />But from the highs of Olympic glory, it can be a tough reality when it is all over and elite sporting careers come to an end.<br /><br />Athletes dedicate their lives to their discipline, and research shows most will suffer mentally when it is time to retire.<br /><br />For retiring athletes, it is not just a career change, but a complete lifestyle adjustment and University of Queensland psychologist Dr Stacey Parker said it was due to the &quot;sporting dream&quot; being so encompassing.<br /><br />&quot;It's such a big part of their identity,&quot; she said.<br /><br />&quot;The majority [of athletes] do report feeling some significant distress and identity loss when making that transition.&quot;<br /><br />Research has found around 16 per cent of athletes suffer severe mental health issues, like substance abuse, and even homelessness in life outside competitive sport.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the remaining 84 per cent are not exempt from a negative experience.<br /><br />Dr Parker said it was because a really important part of their identity was gone.<br /><br />&quot;Also really quite strong support networks, in terms of teammates or other colleagues in sport, coaches, the sporting organisation that they were part of, they lose a significant source of their social support as well,&quot; she said.<br /><br />It was also not uncommon for elite athletes to notice dramatic physical changes.<br /><br />Athletes go from having daily doses of serotonin from all the exercise and when this suddenly decreased, it played with the chemistry in the human body, most notably, their mood.<br /><br />With the reduced training, their nutrition would also need to adapt, but psychologist Amelia Moyse said disordered eating could be a byproduct.<br /><br />&quot;Because their intake needs have changed so significantly, and they do struggle at times to find the new balance at that phase of life,&quot; she said.<br /><br /><br /><br />ABC News In-depth takes you deeper on the big stories, with long-form journalism from Four Corners, Foreign Correspondent, Australian Story, Planet America and more, and explainers from ABC News Video Lab.<br /><br />Watch more ABC News content ad-free on iview: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ab.co/2OB7Mk1">https://ab.co/2OB7Mk1</a><br /><br />For more from ABC News, click here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ab.co/2kxYCZY">https://ab.co/2kxYCZY</a><br /><br />Get breaking news and livestreams from our ABC News channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/NewsOnABC">https://www.youtube.com/user/NewsOnABC</a><br />Like ABC News on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/abcnews.au">http://facebook.com/abcnews.au</a><br />Follow ABC News on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/abcnews_au">http://instagram.com/abcnews_au</a><br />Follow ABC News on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/abcnews">http://twitter.com/abcnews</a><br /><br />Note: In most cases, our captions are auto-generated.<br />#LifeAfterEliteSport<br />#Explainer <br />#ABCNews{% endraw %}
