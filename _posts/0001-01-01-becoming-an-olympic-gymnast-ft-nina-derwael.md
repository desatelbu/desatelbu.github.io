{% raw %}One of my favorite Olympic sports has always been gymnastics. The flips, the risks and most of all the nice choreos on the floor. Nina Derwael has been one of the most dominant gymnasts in the world for the pas few years. And at 21 years old she is already 2 times world champion, 2 times European champion and the current Olympic champion. That's crazy! So we decided to meet up to learn a few moves! Unfortunately, I broke my toe in the first 5 minutes haha. Enjoy the video!<br /><br />THANKS FOR WATCHING ❤️<br /><br />merch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://averagerob.com">https://averagerob.com</a><br />watch zaddy: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/xx1MIwPLoCc">https://youtu.be/xx1MIwPLoCc</a><br />instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/averagerob">http://instagram.com/averagerob</a><br />edited by: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/milancools">https://www.instagram.com/milancools</a><br /><br />TAGS: gymnastics, nina derwael, simone biles, uneven bars, floor, beam, belgium, olympic games, tokyo 2020, salto, cartwheel, broken toe{% endraw %}
