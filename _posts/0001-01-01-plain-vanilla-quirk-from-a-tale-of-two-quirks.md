{% raw %}You have a very important decision to make.  You won't know how important until some unspecified time in the future.  Then you will know.  Which Quirk do you choose?  The extra strength, candy- striper strength Captain Quirk, or the plain vanilla Quirk.  Well many people don't need that Crazy Rocky Mountain Nut flavor of the day, plain vanilla is just fine, thank you.  Frankly, there's a Captain Quirk flavor that will work for nearly anyone.  How about both Quirks; is that quirky enough for you.{% endraw %}
