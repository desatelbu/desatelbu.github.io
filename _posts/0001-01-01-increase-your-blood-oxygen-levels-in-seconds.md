{% raw %}Nasal breathing keeps air in your lungs longer than mouth breathing, and provides up to 20% more oxygen in your bloodstream at any given time.  During nasal breathing, your nose releases nitric oxide (NO). NO is a vasodilator, which means it helps to widen blood vessels. This will increase blood flow throughout the body, lowers blood pressure, boosts immunity, fights cancers, helps with eye health, and helps the lungs absorb more oxygen. <br /><br />Please subscribe so you and your family can stay healthy and happy.   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/motivationaldoc">https://www.youtube.com/user/motivationaldoc</a><br /><br />Please share this video with your friends and family.
