{% raw %}and we made some delicious cookies with the kids!!<br /><br />JOIN OUR FAM!! --- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/rfgp8V">http://goo.gl/rfgp8V</a><br /><br />Best Inside Day Ever 1093<br /><br />Working from home is kinda nice, I have a cool little set up in the basement where I can move around and sit in different chairs and I can also take the secret passage out into the backyard and be right by the skate park. So like right now, I head out and Adley and Niko are jumping up and down in puddles!! I love being able to just pause and play with the family. Since it's a rainy day, we decide to pug up the drain in the skatepark so we can catch as much water as possible and play in it. <br /><br />In order to get more rain we have a rain dance fashion show. It's kinda like a dance battle but everyone can do it and its much more fancy. It's like a dance battle got a make over. We also grab a little swimming pool and some water toys to play with while it's raining! It's starts to get super windy outside, so the kiddos and i escape back into the house through my hidden tunnel and we meet back up with mom where we all cuddle and decided to watch the newest BDE vlog!<br /><br />After the vlog and some naps, we want to do some arts and crafts. So we start making home made cards for our friends, the spacestation crew, and our Adley and Niko's grandparents since we can't see them right now. We use stickers and color pencils to make awesome cards and plans to leave them at their houses. <br /><br />We are all feeling a little hungry, but we can't decide what we want. The kiddos want cookies but Jenny and I want brownies. So to settle, we do some trick shots in basketball hoop. but... we really shouldn't do that in the house, because both Jenny and I missed we accidentally broke a light. Not bad, but it's broken! <br /><br />So Adley leans to make cookies with Jenny, while i get some work done before we clean up the backyard and jumping in the purple tesla to take notes to our family! We miss them so much!! <br /><br />\\\\<br />Watch Adley's last video: Adley vs Dad BIKE TRACK RACE!!
