{% raw %}All organisations have come to depend on their IT performance to some extent and that dependency is increasing year by year. For a growing proportion of companies their &quot;Information Technology&quot; performance has become what determines their capacity to make more money in the future. So, what is the problem? What is the constraint?<br /><br />A manager’s instinct is to strive to control everything. That is not just ineffective, it is a practical impossibility. So, where should managers commit finite resources to achieve their enterprise’s mission?<br /><br />If you are looking for new ideas to define your technological strategies, or better manage your IT, then this webinar, &quot;Constraint Management for Information Technology&quot;, could help you find answers. Dr. John Ricketts, distinguished engineer from IBM (Ret.) and author of the books &quot;Reaching the Goal&quot; [2009] and the recently published &quot;Exceeding the Goal&quot; [2020], will show you how the implementation of Constraint Management principles (a.k.a. the Theory Of Constraints / TOC) can bring tremendous results in IT environments.<br /><br /><br />Marris Consulting is a management consulting firm dedicated to manufacturing companies. Our motto : Factories, People &amp; Results{% endraw %}
