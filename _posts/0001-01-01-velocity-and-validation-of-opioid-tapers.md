{% raw %}In this video Dr Anna Lembke discusses the importance of the velocity of tapering off opioids; don't go too fast, don't go backwards, it's okay to take breaks, and let the patient determine the pace.<br /><br />About &quot;How to Taper Patients Off of Chronic Opioid Therapy&quot;:<br />Doctors may be equipped to prescribe for chronic pain but they are often not given enough opportunities to consider real-time strategies for creating healthy, productive conversations and plans to fight opioid addiction. Dr Anna Lembke's short course, &quot;How to Taper Patients Off of Chronic Opioid Therapy&quot; seeks to remedy this. In a series of short videos, we demonstrate methods for having difficult conversations with opioid dependent/addicted patients, managing the tapering process off opioids, and we explore non-medication alternative therapies such as Dialectical Behavioral Therapy.<br /><br />Note: viewing this videos does not qualify you for CME credit.
