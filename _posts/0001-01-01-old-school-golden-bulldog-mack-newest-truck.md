{% raw %}Join along as I check out a 1974 Mack with a golden bulldog which means all Mack components in the truck... Then it is mine to keep it living and working in the fleet. Much more to come with this truck and the 2022 plans. Thanks for watching along.<br /><br />Merchandise Store- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://duffyag.com/">https://duffyag.com/</a>{% endraw %}
