{% raw %}â–  NICOSIA, CYPRUS: I joined a group tour of Cyprus to investigate the incredible history of this island first hand. I expected the highlight of said tour to be the many mountain-top Venetian castles that still stand proud and strong along the coastline of Cyprus. <br /><br />Whilst the one medieval fortress I visited was indeed impressive, I ended up aborting the tour to set up an appointment with a woman I ran into that first day who told me she makes mosaics! <br /><br />But does she really make them herself? Are there really artists that have kept this epic ancient craft which was the principal art form in the Byzantine empire alive? And can I order my very own custom mosaic of whatever motif I like? <br /><br />I had a million questions and hence spent the next week figuring it all out. Here's how it went!<br /><br />â–  Altun Mosaic Maker: <br />E-mail: atilansanatkultur@gmail.com<br />What's App: +90 542 877 15 09<br />- Whilst the easiest way to order is to meet her in her shop on Cyprus, you can also contact her and see what can be done if you live in another country. I'd recommend getting a painting though as she's incredibly skilled in capturing the scenes of Greek mythology and other historical themes on a canvas. Plus paintings are easy to ship whereas Mosaics are near impossible to transport (unless you pick it up yourself). <br /><br />â–  TO DONATE OR READ ABOUT SUNIL'S CANCER FOUNDATION:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.leonardoedwardshresthafoundation.org/donate/">https://www.leonardoedwardshresthafoundation.org/donate/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/leoshresthafoundation/">https://www.facebook.com/leoshresthafoundation/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.leonepal.org">https://www.leonepal.org</a><br />Phone: 651.243.1234<br />You can contact Sunil through e-mail, DMs or phone.
