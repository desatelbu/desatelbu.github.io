{% raw %}Ember is all about components. How do we effectively document all of the components that are being used in a growing application and make sure that everyone is on the same page?<br /><br />In this presentation, Dan talks about how he addressed this at his company by creating an Ember Component Guide, which documents all of the reusable components that are used in their web application. This is &quot;living&quot;, as the guide uses the actual components themselves.<br /><br />He talks about how he created the Guide and how it has improved reuse, visibility, and communication among their engineers and designers.<br /><br />Music by bensound.com{% endraw %}
