{% raw %}Dietetics education and practice is currently focused on development of devices for nutritional assessment, hands-on clinical assessment skills and personalized medical nutrition therapy. This is in contrast of past years when “traditional” nutritional assessment was mainly based on collecting background information gathered from patient’s medical record and nutritional anamnesis. <br />This new way of assessment is accompanied with number of technologies helping dietitians to link clinical assessment to personalized interventions.<br />In this up-coming session participants will explore selected technologies by addressing three questions:<br />1) What technologies (or gaps) are available for dietetics practice?<br />2) Are presented technologies reliable and valid for all patient populations?<br />3) What is the impact of incorporating technology in dietetics practice on patient outcomes?<br />During the webinar participants will explore short demonstrations using case studies of how technology can be specifically used in providing personalized nutrition interventions and counseling.<br /><br />About the presenter:<br />Dr. Shelly Rachman-Elbaum is an experienced RD in health-care settings. She is also a lecturer and a researcher in several universities as well as a member of the European IMPECD project (The Improvement of Education and Competences in Dietetics).{% endraw %}
