Consult your financial Advisor before investing your money.<br /><br />Timestamp<br />0:00 Introduction<br />1:49 Part 1: Past performance (financial data)<br />10:57 Part 2: Future prospects (qualitative data)<br />13:13 Conclusion<br /><br />Stock market is very facinating. On one hand, right stocks can help you create wealth. On the other hand, wrong stocks can destroy your wealth. A majority of retail investors end up picking wrong stocks and that result in wealth destruction. Hence, in this video, I have discussed the top elimination criteria I use to avoid investing in bad stocks. I have divided this video in 2 parts. In 1st part, I have discussed the elimination criteria based on past performance i.e. financial data. In the 2nd part, I have discussed elimination criteria based on future growth prospects. This video would help investors in identifying criteria to avoid investing in bad stocks.<br /><br />#stockmarket #elimination #badstocks{% endraw %}
