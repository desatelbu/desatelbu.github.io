Today's video takes a look at glorious evening take off by an Emirates A380 which prior to the pandemic was a common visitor to Melbourne. It was always a treat to have EK 405 depart from Melbourne to Singapore during a late afternoon and evening. Stunning shots like these were common during Spring and Autumn seasons, these being from October 2018. I've included some additional information about this particular aircraft below for those interested. Enjoy and fingers crossed these are flying back sooner rather than later in some shape or form. Cheers<br />Tom<br /><br />Aircraft Information:<br />MSN: 057<br />Aircraft Type: A380 - 861<br />Roll out: May 26th 2010<br />First Flight: June 11th 2010<br />Age: 11.3 Years<br />Engines: 4x GP7270<br />Filming Year: October 2018.<br /><br />FOOTAGE MAY NOT BE USED WITHOUT PERMISSION{% endraw %}
