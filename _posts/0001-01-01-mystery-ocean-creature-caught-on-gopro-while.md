{% raw %}<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/Brandonkop">http://www.youtube.com/Brandonkop</a> While out fishing the Wild Big Sur Coast I was surrounded by dense fog not able to see the shore or anything else.  On my kayak I was trying out a new GoPro Camera angle... the only fear factor is when you watch it later you can see what was actually behind you!!!  Check out this mystery creature that is visible in the water as a large swell passes by.  I was about half a mile off shore when this sighting occurred.  I obviously saw something out of my peripheral vision, but had no idea what it was.  Out in the Wild ocean of Big Sur you can see anything from Killer Whales, dolphins, Great White Sharks, Grey Whales, Otters and Sea lions.  I'm not exactly sure what this one is... but a little scary to know I wasn't alone!  It never appeared again on camera....<br /><br />If you want to watch more footage from fishing that day check out this video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://youtu.be/f0qpEapltgE">http://youtu.be/f0qpEapltgE</a> <br /><br /><br />PLEASE SUBSCRIBE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXufI8Him5ixNfzMxJmWU-w?sub_confirmation=1">http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXufI8Him5ixNfzMxJmWU-w?sub_confirmation=1</a> <br />Check out THE FISHING DOCTOR'S BLOG for more fishing trip details and tips: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://thefishingdoctorsadventures.blogspot.com/">http://thefishingdoctorsadventures.blogspot.com/</a>{% endraw %}
