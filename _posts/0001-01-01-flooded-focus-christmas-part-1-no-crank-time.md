{% raw %}Time for the PHAD Christmas Special!<br /><br />This 2017 Ford Focus was purchased at an auction as a flooded vehicle with only 15k miles.<br />The owner is determined to get it back on the road and re-sell it.<br />He already swapped in a used BCM and PCM, and the car does not crank.<br /><br />I did the initial diagnosis more than a YEAR AGO, and then got called back in this year, since this is a car is the gift that keeps on giving :)<br /><br />LAUNCH DIAGUN V:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072FHLYRY?ref=exp_pinehollowautodiagnostics_dp_vv_d">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072FHLYRY?ref=exp_pinehollowautodiagnostics_dp_vv_d</a><br /><br />Merry Christmas!<br />Ivan{% endraw %}
