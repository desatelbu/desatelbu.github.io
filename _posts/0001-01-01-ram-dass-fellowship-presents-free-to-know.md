{% raw %}When we are intimate with the part of ourselves that never dies, genuine confidence emerges organically.  It has nothing to do with what our job title is, how we look, how much money we make, or how many friends we have. When genuine confidence emerges, the transient insecurities we experience in life don’t have a stronghold on us, and we experience a sense of satisfaction in our own skin.<br /><br />Transcending genres, Simrit’s musical education is rich and diverse. From singing in the Orthodox church starting in grade school, all the way through high school where she was studying vocals at the University of South Carolina with her childhood piano teacher…and then studying some with the classical Indian system of music. She is known for her voice reverberating a sound that is simultaneously ancient and fresh. Decades of study and experimentation with Kundalini yoga deepened Simrit’s relationship to the quantum technology of Naad Yoga (the ancient science of using sound to impact the brain’s neural pathways and chemicals, eliciting altered states of reality); the effects of which influence her music.<br /><br />Alongside her band, Simrit creates vibrationally powerful and healing music to impact both positive internal &amp; external change. And she is a deep lover of Ram Dass.<br /><br />----<br /><br />Listen to SIMRIT's newly released single, Guru Ram Dass on the Soul Land Music Series Vol.1 Compilation Album : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://onerpm.link/soullandmusicseries">https://onerpm.link/soullandmusicseries</a><br /><br />----<br /><br />To learn more about the Ram Dass Fellowship and sign up to join satsang near you, visit RamDass.org/Fellowship<br /><br />&amp;<br /><br />If you have the means and would like to support the continuation of this free livestream series, please consider leaving a donation at the provided link, or at RamDass.org/Donate{% endraw %}
