{% raw %}Those who walk merely by sight will almost always despair at the conditions in the sin-sick world around them. In this session, Dr. R.C. Sproul will remind us that the world ultimately exists to make manifest the glory of Christ. He will affirm that in the midst of our hardships or in the midst of decline, God is on His throne, working all things according to the good pleasure of His will. He will encourage us by saying that while we labor in God's name, the Lord does indeed reign.<br /><br />This message is from our 2014 National Conference, Overcoming the World: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL30acyfm60fUL14v3dD7qgbSyBbV055jG">http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL30acyfm60fUL14v3dD7qgbSyBbV055jG</a><br /><br />Purchase this conference on DVD: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.ligonier.org/store/overcoming-the-world-2014-national-conference-dvd/?mobile=off">http://www.ligonier.org/store/overcoming-the-world-2014-national-conference-dvd/?mobile=off</a>{% endraw %}
