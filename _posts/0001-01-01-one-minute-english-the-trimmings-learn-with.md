{% raw %}I'll be taking a couple of weeks off over the festive period, so here's the second of three Xmas-themed videos I'll be sharing with you before then.<br /><br />This is a short video explaining to English language students how to use the common noun (WITH ALL) THE TRIMMINGS. We aim to show students how to learn English fast â€“ and provide an easy way to learn English. This video is designed for Intermediate, Upper-Intermediate and Advanced students learning English as a foreign language and is part of a series that looks at everyday English and common words, chunks, idioms, phrasal verbs, phrases and expressions used in spoken English - and British English in particular. It includes a story, an explanation of the common idiom and some examples which will help EFL and ESOL students understand and use the lexical item. It's suitable for students studying for the IELTS, Cambridge First Certificate (FCE), Cambridge Advanced (CAE) and Cambridge Proficiency (CPE) exams. It will also help anyone who wants to improve their knowledge of English idioms, English vocabulary and English grammar. CELTA- and DELTA-qualified English teachers may also find it helpful, especially teachers who use a lexical approach.{% endraw %}
