{% raw %}Nikkei cuisine is at the heart of Chotto-Matte. <br /><br />Nikkei cuisine is a blend of culinary cultures developed over 100 years ago when Japanese workers immigrated to Peru and combined their cooking techniques with local Peruvian ingredients. <br /><br />Today Executive Chef Jordan Sclare creates Nikkei dishes that not only capture the flavours of Peru but also its bright, vivacious colours making every dish look as beautiful as it tastes.<br /><br />Nikkei cuisine is all about exceptional quality, natural ingredients and flavours. <br /><br />Chotto-Matte has an exciting urban contemporary ambiance that makes people come back again and again.<br /><br />With exotic Nikkei cocktails, modern eclectic music, glamour, fun and excitement, Chotto Matte showcases the very best of Soho.<br /><br />Chotto-Matte is a large diverse restaurant on 2 floors.<br /><br />On the ground floor is a busy cocktail bar, styled using black lava stone. There is also a lounge, a small dining area for private functions, a Tostadita counter where you can just turn up, no need to book.  <br /><br />Also, when the weather is good, we open the glass doors to create a lively seating area outside overlooking the street life of Soho.<br /><br />On the first floor is the main dining room plus a “first come first served” Robata counter and Sushi Bar.<br /> <br />There is a lot going on and to experience. As owner Kurt Zdesar says “It takes a few visits before you will really see everything that Chotto-Matte has to offer”.<br /><br />If want an experience that transports you away from your day-to-day, <br />Chotto-Matte is the place to come.{% endraw %}
