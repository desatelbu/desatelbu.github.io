{% raw %}In the marketing world, there is a class of people called HENRYs which hold much of the total buying power of the United States.<br />► Get 2 FREE stocks valued up to $2300 and $5 of SHIBA INU: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2XwlcQ4">http://bit.ly/2XwlcQ4</a><br />► Cellphone Plan I use for only $15/month: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mintmobile.com/bush">https://mintmobile.com/bush</a><br />► Bank Anywhere in the World with a VPN: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3G31YsL">https://bit.ly/3G31YsL</a><br />► Get $10 of FREE Bitcoin with $100 Purchase at Coinbase: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3AXRUNJ">https://bit.ly/3AXRUNJ</a><br />► Protect your Cyptos with a Hardware Wallet: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3ldMbyR">https://bit.ly/3ldMbyR</a><br />► Get a FREE Finance Audio Book: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2Z4RrN7">https://bit.ly/2Z4RrN7</a><br />► Early Notice of When I Buy or Sell: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.patreon.com/BeatTheBush">http://www.patreon.com/BeatTheBush</a><br />► Build Credit with no Credit by Self Lending: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://self-lender.3qcw.net/YYZBP">https://self-lender.3qcw.net/YYZBP</a><br />► Products on Amazon I recommend: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/shop/BeatTheBush">http://www.amazon.com/shop/BeatTheBush</a><br />► Channel T-shirt, Honey Badger T-shirt: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2FBAeLA">http://bit.ly/2FBAeLA</a><br /><br />This class of people are high income earners and not shy of spending on luxury goods. This class is important for luxury brands because they will only increase their buying power for the years to come. Here, I describe what they are and how these very people can avoid this debt trap. Having minimal savings while pulling it well over six figures is unacceptable when once could save up a huge nest egg in a short amount of time. With this nest egg, you can then generate all the spending power you need with investments. HENRYs are known to spend heavily on luxury goods which results in only 214k of assets. With an average of 177k of income in this category, one would technically be possible to save that much in just 2 years. Given 10 years, one would have $1M. <br /><br />Lastly, I offer ways to not fall into this type of Social Acceptance type of spending and instead opt for increasing self confidence by way of a purposeful life. With a found purpose that allows you to continually improve, it generates plenty of good feeling, lowers your expenses, and can even extend your life.<br /><br />Most Updated Other Channels:<br />BTB Foods: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/BeatTheBushFoods">https://www.youtube.com/c/BeatTheBushFoods</a><br />BTB DIY: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/BeatTheBushDIY">https://www.youtube.com/c/BeatTheBushDIY</a><br />BTB Tesla: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/BeatTheBushTesla">https://www.youtube.com/c/BeatTheBushTesla</a><br />BTB Tech: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/BeatTheBushTech">https://www.youtube.com/c/BeatTheBushTech</a><br />BTB Travel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC79sZopqW55wsHvpcdCZ-w">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC79sZopqW55wsHvpcdCZ-w</a><br />BTB ASMR: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtDb1N3BjoGPqZX5JZmiT-A">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtDb1N3BjoGPqZX5JZmiT-A</a>{% endraw %}
