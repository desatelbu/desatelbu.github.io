{% raw %}2020 was a difficult year for everyone and let’s hope we can all put this behind us! But as funny as it is, the past year ended up being quite memorable for Fred and the crew. You want to know why? Because fly fishing is the best remedy out there. Follow our journey through the wild rivers of Terrace BC, the lacs and rivers of Eeyou Istchee Baie-James and the magnificent Matapedia river in Gaspesie. We get out there in search of Big Pike, Atlantic Salmon, Steelhead and Coho Salmon. Follow us on this expedition in some of the most beautiful places on earth!{% endraw %}
