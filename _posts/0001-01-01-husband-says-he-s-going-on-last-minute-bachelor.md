{% raw %}Husband and I have toddler and a newborn and we are short with money at the moment. We live far away from our parents and sibling so no one can come and help us. Today husband told he is going on bachelor party with his boys to Vegas. I told him he is not going because he has two kids and money issues and now he's mad I'm controlling.<br /><br /><br />#redditrelationshipadvice #aitahusband #aitawife<br /><br /><br /><br />If you want your story removed from a video, please email me at ask.elana.yt@gmail.com<br /><br />Submit your stories and chat with me at ask.elana.yt@gmail.com{% endraw %}
