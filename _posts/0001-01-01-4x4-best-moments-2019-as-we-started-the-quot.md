{% raw %}As we started the &quot;Best 4x4 Moments&quot; video series back in 2017, looking back with the highlights of the past year of wheeling, we bring you the third instalment of almost 45 minutes of action packed four-wheel driving.<br /><br />As with 2018 being a year of struggling to produce videos, 2019 was even harder, harder than ever so far. Family had to move house and a lot of focus went into working on our new home to make it comfortable for the family to live in. I still haven't been able to build the studio due to other overwhelming work that was prioritised so that the family is kept happy. This has compromised the time for offroading, wrenching, modding, vlogging, editing, and everything that goes with this hobby. There will be at least another couple of months before I start seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. Also, still have the workshop to build.<br /><br />Anyway, as I have pinched some time here and there to edit this video, I hope that you like the end result, and please stay tuned (but be patient with me) for more.<br /><br />If you would like to support me, click on the Patreon link here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/AussieFourWheelers">https://www.patreon.com/AussieFourWheelers</a><br /><br />Alternatively, you can press the JOIN button on this channel to join the AFW Membership and support me that way.

It's at least you could do for support and doesn't cost you anything. Much appreciated. Thank you.<br /><br /><br /><br />E<br /><br />N<br /><br />J<br /><br />O<br /><br />Y{% endraw %}
