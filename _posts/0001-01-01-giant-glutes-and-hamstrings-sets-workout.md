{% raw %}Hip thrusts, sumo squads, Romanian deadlifts and bodyweight exercises all combined into giant sets to make this an very demanding and intense workout for the entire glutes and hamstrings! <br /><br />For this demanding session you will need a pair of dumbbells or one heavier dumbbell, your mat, a glute band and a chair/bench for hip thrusts. I also use a towel to place under the dumbbell during hip thrusts! <br /><br />I am using only one dumbbell of 25kg throughout this workout today but you could use 1 x kettlebell, barbell or 2 x dumbbells! <br /><br />There is a staple of hip thrusts giant sets in today’s workout consisting of using the band with dumbbell then dropping dumbbell to bodyweight with the band only! The staple only appears 3 times in total!<br /><br />The Irene will be on for 45 seconds each exercise, moving straight into the next. Once we complete the giant set (4 exercises today), we then have 30 seconds rest!<br /><br />Please remember the timer is only a guide! You may need to take a brief second to reset during points of the giant sets! Take those few seconds as it is a lot time for a set; 3 minutes! <br /><br />ON ELBOWS PULSES!<br />FULL RANGE!<br />ON HANDS PULSES!<br />FULL RANGE!<br /><br />HAMSTRING THRUST 1/2 REPS!<br />FULL RANGE!<br />BODYWEIGHT 1/2 REPS!<br />FULL RANGE!<br /><br />STAPLE!<br />BANDED HIP THRUST 1/2 REPS!<br />FULL RANGE!<br />BODYWEIGHT 1/2 REPS!<br />FULL RANGE!<br /><br />STAGGERED HIP THRUST 1/2 REPS!<br />FULL RANGE!<br />SINGLE LEG 1/2 REPS!<br />FULL RANGE!<br /><br />STAGGERED HIP THRUST 1/2 REPS!<br />FULL RANGE!<br />SINGLE LEG 1/2 REPS!<br />FULL RANGE!<br /><br />STAPLE!<br />BANDED HIP THRUST 1/2 REPS!<br />FULL RANGE!<br />BODYWEIGHT 1/2 REPS!<br />FULL RANGE!<br /><br />HAMSTRING LIFT!<br />SINGLE LEG BRIDGE!<br />HAMSTRING LIFT!<br />X1 LEG BRIDGE NO REST AT BOTTOM!<br /><br />HAMSTRING LIFT!<br />SINGLE LEG BRIDGE!<br />HAMSTRING LIFT!<br />X1 LEG BRIDGE NO REST AT BOTTOM!<br /><br />STAPLE!<br />BANDED HIP THRUST 1/2 REPS!<br />FULL RANGE!<br />BODYWEIGHT 1/2 REPS!<br />FULL RANGE!<br /><br />1/2 REP SUMO SQUATS!<br />FULL RANGE!<br />BODYWEIGHT 1/2 REPS!<br />SUMO SQUAT TO HAND TAP!<br /><br />SUMO SQUAT TO RDL!<br />RDL!<br />1 1/2 REP RDL!<br />1/2 REP RDL!<br /><br />Finisher! <br /><br />30/30/30<br /><br />DOUBLE LEG HAMSTRING LIFT!<br />HOLD!<br />NO REST AT BOTTOM!<br /><br />I have no doubt if you really utilise your band, aim for solid reps and full contraction, you will love these giant sets!! <br /><br />Giant sets require giant effort!
