{% raw %}On this day the swell was relatively large. Searched for a location that was barely fishable and it payed off. Had to keep a very close eye on the swell and fish correctly. it only takes one good fish on the outing and this was it! <br /> Sydney rocks can be challenging as they are heavily fished in most locations. Hope you enjoy this video. <br /><br />The outfit used on the outing: <br /><br />• Rod- Daiwa Over There 109MH 328cm 10-20lb.<br />• Reel- Daiwa 5000D H BG MQ.<br />• Line- 20 lb J Braid Grand. <br />• Leader- 20lb J Thread FC<br />• Hobie Life jacket 50+{% endraw %}
