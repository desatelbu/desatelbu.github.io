{% raw %}Phrasal Verbs Course: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.espressoenglish.net/phrasal-verbs-intensive-course">http://www.espressoenglish.net/phrasal-verbs-intensive-course</a><br />Free e-book 500 Real English Phrases: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.espressoenglish.net/500phrases">http://www.espressoenglish.net/500phrases</a><br /><br />Someone asked me if there's a difference between finish and finish up. The answer is no - there's no difference in meaning. Finish up is just more informal.<br /><br />But is this the case for every verb / phrasal verb? No!<br /><br />In today's lesson you'll learn the small differences between show and show off, follow and follow up, and several more verb and phrasal verb pairs.<br /><br />There are certainly a lot of little details to remember when it comes to phrasal verbs. That's why it's so important to learn phrasal verbs in context - when you learn how phrasal verbs are used in real situations, it's much more effective than trying to memorize lists of definitions.<br /><br />You can learn this way inside my Phrasal Verbs in Conversation Course! Not only will you learn more than 500 phrasal verbs through the dialogues in the lessons, but you'll also put them into practice with quizzes and exercises.{% endraw %}
