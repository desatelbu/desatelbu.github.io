{% raw %}COMING SOON<br /><br />Purchase DCS: F/A-18C Hornet from:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/en/shop/modules/hornet/">https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/en/shop/modules/hornet/</a><br /><br />Hey everyone, Wags here from Eagle Dynamics.<br /><br />In this DCS: F/A-18C Hornet video, we’ll look at the auto throttle control in approach mode.<br /><br />In addition to the Auto Throttle Control (ATC) Cruise mode, in which the aircraft maintains the set airspeed, the ATC Approach Mode will maintain the set angle of attack when the aircraft is configured for landing. This allows landing approaches with your hand off the throttle and instead controlling AoA with just the stick pitch of the aircraft; the flight control system will automatically adjust the throttles to maintain the set AoA.<br /><br />Most often used in Case III recoveries, this is a particularly useful features when combined with the upcoming Automatic Carrier Landing System (ACLS) for fully automated landings.<br /><br />For this demonstration, we’ll pick up a Case III just prior to 10 miles and use the ATC in approach mode to recover.{% endraw %}
