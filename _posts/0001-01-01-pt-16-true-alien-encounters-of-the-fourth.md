{% raw %}The Strange Entity I reveal in this video was the first and last time I ever seen it. <br />Keep in mind that the odd humanoid looked absolutely real, it appeared to be flesh and blood. It did not look cartoony or projected. <br />I believed it was there I even felt it.<br /> It looked and felt absolutely 100% real.<br /><br />I cannot thank everyone enough for all the support, with everything I’ve got going on personally and I have very little free time working on the channel while working full time. it’s getting really hard to answer individual questions and to carry constant constructive conversations. I’m really sorry I know there’s messages and emails I haven’t gotten to yet, but So far almost all questions have been something that will be answered later in the series.<br />I will get back to everyone who has written or reached out in some form up until this point. But I think I’m going to ask everyone if possible just ask a question that I can answer to multiple people in a video. A lot of folks have had the same questions. And I plan to do way more with this channel then what I’m doing now. I assure everyone that the ideas I have for this channel will be very interesting and entertaining.<br />I plan to do Q and A videos as well as recaps of videos with full commentary of my thoughts on the material what they were then and what they are now.<br />Loads of ideas but honestly I probably need the channel to take off more before I’ll be able to justify all the time and resources that’s going to be needed to do everything.<br /><br />Thank you all so much again, I’m sorry for those who still haven’t gotten a response from me. Im getting to everyone a little bit at a time.<br /><br />Thanks as always to the channel <br /><br />Breaking Copyright © <br />Music for your videos <br /><br />For supplying me with free music for my channel. I have my own music I paid for yet breaking Copyright has better music.<br /><br />Songs in my videos are <br /><br />Ross Bugden <br />“Haunted”<br /><br />And<br /><br />The frequent song used in my latest videos <br />Is from<br /><br />Darren Curtis <br />“It’s in The Fog”<br /><br />Such great songs <br />Really great producers{% endraw %}
