Get the album here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/savestheday-merch">https://bit.ly/savestheday-merch</a><br /><br />Lyrics:<br />And it's not fair- why do I have to be so low?<br />Oh, I feel everything much more<br />Much more than you ever will<br />And it's too hard when I can't even catch your eye<br />So I can't send you messages<br />And at night I dream of reasons I can't let you go<br />I don't know if it's time to crack through your walls<br />So thick I can't see past you<br />So now that winter comes<br />The cold beats harder<br />And no one is left alone<br />And I'm offering you me right now  <br />Take me I'm yours<br />And I won't have it any other way<br />So don't let fools be carried by what I say<br />The night keeps lookin' our way<br />And you're not seein' what I'm missin'<br />I am missing you<br />And I think that we should run as fast as we can<br />Into what we don't know<br />It's time to let me in<br />I feel just fine<br /><br /><br />#savestheday #cantslowdown{% endraw %}
