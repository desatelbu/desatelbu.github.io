{% raw %}Broken leg, broken tooth, nerve damage... that's a lot to handle even if you have a home, so imagine doing it homeless without the ability to speak.  Luckily, a #HopeForPaws supporter spotted #Zorro and called us for help.  JoAnn Wiltz accomplished the mission successfully, got him to CARES, and then the medical process started to literally get him back on his 4 feet.<br /><br />I am so happy Dr. Pedraza was able to save his hind leg, and I am now super impressed with the neurological injury... I did not see that kind of recovery coming!<br /><br />Your donations are making all of these miracles possible and I just want to ask every person to donate just $5 so we can continue helping more and more animals.  Our vet bills are HUGE and together we can ensure that our work is never slowed down.  Just think of it as getting an extra cup of coffee for Zorro and his friends - please be their superhero today here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.HopeForPaws.org">https://www.HopeForPaws.org</a> ‚ù§Ô∏è<br /><br />Thank you Kitty Bungalow so much for finding him a foster who loves him so much and wouldn't let him go.  Don't you worry... they have many others who are still looking for a home here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.KittyBungalow.org">https://www.KittyBungalow.org</a><br /><br />Please LIKE this video so we can get to more people.<br /><br />Thank you so much!!!<br /><br />Eldad<br /><br />#Cat{% endraw %}
