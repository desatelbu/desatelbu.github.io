{% raw %}#eldenring #darksouls #gaming<br />Bandai Namco recently announced that they will be running a stream at New York Comic Con 2021. Elden Ring has a good chance of being there since it is one of the only new Bandai namco games coming out soon. Lots of evidence is pointing to it being there and with the absence of Elden Ring news recently, I believe it is possible. Elden Ring is an upcoming action role-playing game developed by FromSoftware and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment. The game is a collaborative effort between game director Hidetaka Miyazaki and fantasy novelist George R. R. Martin. <br /><br />Music:<br />Metroid Prime 2 OST{% endraw %}
