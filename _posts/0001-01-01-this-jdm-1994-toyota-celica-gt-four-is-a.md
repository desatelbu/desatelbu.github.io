{% raw %}When I first saw this car I have admit to rolling my eyes a little bit.  As a gearhead kid, I was raised on American V8s, and the birth of the Ricer movement seemed strange and offensive - not to mention expensive.  The cost per HP of a 4 cylinder turbo in 1991 was a hell of a lot more than in a small block Chevy.  As the turbo world eclipsed the V8 world, I lost interest and bought a Buick Riviera.<br /><br />I regret that now, because I missed out on some pretty neat stuff. The Celicas of the late 80s and early 90s seemed a bit dull and nondescript to me at the time, but having learned more about them later in life, I realize what an important and interesting series of cars these were.<br /><br />That said, the JDM and ricer subculture drives me insane.  I'd rather hang out with Porsche enthusiasts or BMW guys, and that's really saying something.<br /><br />Videos referenced in this video:<br /><br />Review of 1985 Toyota Celica GT-S:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/WkTOf1xb13w">https://youtu.be/WkTOf1xb13w</a><br /><br />Wangan Midnight Movie:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzgwIVg56hM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzgwIVg56hM</a><br /><br />Toyota Rally Cheat Explained:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uu_H6MaQeMU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uu_H6MaQeMU</a>{% endraw %}
