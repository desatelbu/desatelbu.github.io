{% raw %}Rechargeable battery clinch and pierce unit ULBG 452 for mobile use inside and outside a factory.<br /><br />The new BTM clinch and pierce unit ULBG 452 is characterized by its compact, ergonomic construction principle and its high joining force. In addition to efficient Li-Ion rechargeable batteries the unit is also optionally available with a power supply for all common voltage systems.
