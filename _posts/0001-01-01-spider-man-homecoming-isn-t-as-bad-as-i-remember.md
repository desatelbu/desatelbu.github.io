We can't help that we grew up with Tobey, and even Andrew to a point, but perhaps Tom will surprise us upon rewatch‚Ä¶ or does Iron Man's looming shadow over this franchise make him the ultimate villain?<br /><br />This is an audio commentary ONLY. It is meant to be watched along with the movie so you can raise or lower the volume on the commentary or the movie itself as you wish.<br /><br />#spiderman #homecoming #irondiaper{% endraw %}
