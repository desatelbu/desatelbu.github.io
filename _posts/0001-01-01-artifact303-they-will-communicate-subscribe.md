May 2011 by Suntrip Records - SUNCD22<br /><br />After 2 years of hard work, Artifact303 is proud to announce his debut-album called “Back to Space&quot;!<br /><br />Artifact303 is Zsolt Peter, a Hungarian artist from Romania, one of the biggest and brightest rising stars of the melodic Goa-trance genre...! <br />He managed to get this very strong reputation because he released some absolutely superb melodic dance floor killers on compilations last few years.<br /><br />What makes “Back to Space” so unique is the fact that Artifact303 manages to mix fantastic melodies, lots of layers, a great story and brain-stretching climaxes perfectly together... Once you close your eyes and you listen to the music you end up in a hurricane of effects and melodies, putting a smile on your face! :)<br /><br />You liked Astral Projection? MFG? Filteria? Oforia?
