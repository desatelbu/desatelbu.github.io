{% raw %}On this episode of Going Underground, we firstly speak to the former spokesperson for Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. He discusses the 2011 intervention by NATO which ‘silenced the Libyan majority’, why he is in Cairo to coordinate political operations with Libyan counterparts, Britain and the US’ attempts to play with the UN mandate to give ultimate control to the UN instead of the Libyan people, why the Libyan crisis should be viewed as ‘Libya vs foreign powers’, the potential candidacy of Saif Al-Islam Gaddafi and why he believes Saif Al-Islam is a candidate that can bring an end to domination by foreign powers and bring about Libyan dialogue, his criticisms of General Khalifa Haftar having ‘authoritarian dreams’ and being beholden to foreign powers and much more!<br /><br />#Libya #Gaddafi #MiddleEast<br /><br />LIKE Going Underground <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://fb.me/GoingUndergroundRT">http://fb.me/GoingUndergroundRT</a><br /><br />FOLLOW Going Underground <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/Underground_RT">http://twitter.com/Underground_RT</a><br /><br />SUBSCRIBE to Going Underground <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://t.me/joinchat/VBZAzIWb6OWMpKLy?fbclid=IwAR1oBuFpFRH1JSjSugRCrWAmrhRI064ai2hls_z35ldYsRK0RSJykjm8-Ds">https://t.me/joinchat/VBZAzIWb6OWMpKLy?fbclid=IwAR1oBuFpFRH1JSjSugRCrWAmrhRI064ai2hls_z35ldYsRK0RSJykjm8-Ds</a><br /><br />FOLLOW Afshin Rattansi <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/AfshinRattansi">http://twitter.com/AfshinRattansi</a><br /><br />FOLLOW on Instagram <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/underground_rt">http://instagram.com/underground_rt</a>{% endraw %}
