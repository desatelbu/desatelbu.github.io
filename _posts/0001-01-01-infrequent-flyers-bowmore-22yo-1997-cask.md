{% raw %}Infrequent Flyers - Bowmore 22yo 1997 - cask 2688 - 1 of 314 - 48.3%<br /><br />From the famous Walker blood line comes this bottler. Is it good, is it hype? <br /><br />This is the excellent Bowmore 22 year old! <br />An old bowmore is rare, but a GOOD bowmore is even rarer. <br />Most distillery bottlings of bowmore are also deeply artificially coloured. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />#infrequentflyers #bowmore #whiskeyreview #whiskeyreview #islay <br /><br /><br />Music: I'll Meet You There by Sapajou <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/sapajoubeatsCreative">https://soundcloud.com/sapajoubeatsCreative</a> Commons — Attribution 3.0 Unported — CC BY 3.0Free Download / Stream: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/ill-meet-you-thereMusic">http://bit.ly/ill-meet-you-thereMusic</a> promoted by Audio Library <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/P2mC5i3V0G8">https://youtu.be/P2mC5i3V0G8</a>{% endraw %}
