I was typically thinking that life is to enjoy without ethics. It was 2021 where I understood what life is and started to move forward with ethics and discipline. I wanted to record my journey and show how I go in life. All my ups and downs, good and bad will be shown in videos which will be useful for you all to learn something about mistakes and how to overcome all the obstacles. I am not a mentor or some guru, am just a normal ordinary boy who learns from his mistakes. Think of me as your brother or friend. Together we can do wonders. Soon will build a strong community that will be a helping hand for people who are in need of help. Thank you.<br /><br />Feel Free to get in touch with me maverickclub90s@gmail.com for anything which you wanna discuss or serious about.{% endraw %}
