{% raw %}The £200 cheap bike challenge - Will a budget bike last? I buy a budget bike from Halfords and push it to the limits over jumps, berms, skateparks and drops to see if a cheap MTB can handle the big stuff, but will it last?<br /><br />I head into the largest retailer of motoring and cycling products to pick up a cheap bike for under £200 very similar to the quality of bike you'd find in a Walmart or Supermarket and then proceed to push its limits and see how much abuse it can take until the inevitable happens. We start the riding at Hadleigh Olympic park where London hosts the 2012 games and the XC race was held here. After the Olympics they left the park open for the public and kept the DH trails there for anyone to use so I thought this would be a perfect place to test this cheap bike! After being very surprised I then head to an amazing skatepark to see how many tricks can be performed on this bike before moving onto the ultimate stair set of doom! Unfortunately the winter has cut the days down so we had to skip to the next day where we find the breaking point of this bike, but which component would break first?<br /><br />I hope you enjoy the video!<br /><br /><br /><br />MERCH:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tothesky.store/">https://www.tothesky.store/</a><br /><br /><br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br /><br /><br />Welcome to my channel, I'm a professional Freeride Mountain biker and former FMB world champion(2013).  <br /><br /><br /><br />This channel is all about Mountain biking, I make a huge variety of videos for everyone who loves dirt: From downhill biking to slower paced trials riding and everything in between like dirt jumping, slopestyle and enduro!  <br /><br /><br /><br />As well as making entertaining videos(I hope) I also like to help YOU out too, with videos such as:  <br /><br />- How to ride better <br /><br />- Trick tips and How to's <br /><br />- Travel VLOGS <br /><br />- GoPro camera tips <br /><br />- In-depth entertaining features <br /><br />- POV craziness <br /><br />- Funny videos <br /><br /><br /><br /> I also try to reply to everyone so leave some comments too!{% endraw %}
