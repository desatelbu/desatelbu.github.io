{% raw %}Sammy hints to Sue that she's boring! Oops, looks like he's hit! Because today she is going to prove that Sam is outrageously mistaken!<br /><br />Together with you, guys, we'll make the coolest ever mountain track for Hot Wheel little cars. And of course, we need a lot of cardboard. We'll start with mountains and hills. Let's outline all the edges and tunnels that our cars will drive through. Then we need to cut the cardboard according to these lines. Guys, you should always be careful with the cutter. You may even want to ask an adult to help!<br /><br />A mountain road should be picturesque. So we'll draw a blue sky with clouds, mountains and don't forget to add some greenery! After that let's add two sidewalls to make the whole construction steady. <br /><br />Next, we're moving on to building the roads for our mountain track. At this stage, we need cardboard rings, from which we will make a winding track. And the final step is to assemble all the parts of the craft together! In our video tutorial, we will show you in detail what and how to connect.<br /><br />Now it's time to start racing! Our cars can't wait to try out the new track in action!
