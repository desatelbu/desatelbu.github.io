{% raw %}During a hike in a nature trail just a bit outside of Prodromos village at Troodos Mountains we noticed a small quantity of water crossing the trail.  Aimi's and Bakudai's, our two best friends, two red Japanese Akitas, ears pointed to the cliff and we then immediately heard the sound of water falling on the rocks and we decided to stop and take a better look.  The spectacle was breathtaking! (You can watch the live video we posted again here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/6d3ciLT5Vpk)">https://youtu.be/6d3ciLT5Vpk)</a> <br />Due to the heavy rainfall of this winter, streams and small waterfalls are literally everywhere!  Streams that were forgotten in ages due to the past dry winters are now flowing once again.  Although that it was drizzle we couldn't resist and we flew the drone.  Flying the drone close to the cliff and the rocks in a combination of rain, cold and two happy dogs anxiously waiting (because of the smells and the adventure) to move on was quite challenging!<br />Enjoy!<br /><br />The equipment we used to shot this video is:<br />DJI Mavic Pro Drone Combo Kit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2HqEgLR">https://amzn.to/2HqEgLR</a><br />DJI Mavic Pro Filters: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Fm4YTP">https://amzn.to/2Fm4YTP</a><br />Manfrotto Bumblebee-220 PL Pro Light Camea Backpack: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2HrlYu0">https://amzn.to/2HrlYu0</a><br />SanDisk Extreme PRO 32 GB microSDHC Memory Card + SD Adapter up to 95 MB/s, Class 10, U3, V30: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2HpBXsF">https://amzn.to/2HpBXsF</a><br /><br />Meet Aimi: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/llkfcPAq2Ek">https://youtu.be/llkfcPAq2Ek</a><br />Meet Bakudai: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/qZyT-LHoHoQ">https://youtu.be/qZyT-LHoHoQ</a><br /><br />Please subscribe to the channel and leave a comment below!<br /><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://theislandofcyprus.com/">http://theislandofcyprus.com/</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/TheislandofCyprus/?ref=aymt_homepage_panel">https://www.facebook.com/TheislandofCyprus/?ref=aymt_homepage_panel</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/IslandCyprus">https://twitter.com/IslandCyprus</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/the_islandofcyprus/">https://www.instagram.com/the_islandofcyprus/</a><br />Google +: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/110858597714713830036/110858597714713830036">https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/110858597714713830036/110858597714713830036</a>{% endraw %}
