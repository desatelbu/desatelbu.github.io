{% raw %}I flew Air France from Nice to Dubai. During online check-in, I decided to upgrade my ticket from Business Class to La Premiere which is Air France's very exclusive First Class.<br /><br />I was escorted to the plane by an Air France agent in Nice. After a non-eventful 1 hour domestic flight, I arrived at Paris CDG with personal escort and limo to the Air France Salon La Premiere (lounge). I enjoyed some of the great French food and drink there before headed off for my next flight to Dubai.<br /><br />The Air France Paris to Dubai flight was a B777-300/ER. I was fortunate enough to be the only passenger in La Premiere. Take a look at the understated luxury design and elegance of the cabin. Combine with great French gastronomy, La Premiere remains one of my favorite all-time First Class. During the video, I also revealed the best way to fly in La Premiere.{% endraw %}
