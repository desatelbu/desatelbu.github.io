My channel differs from similar ones in that I create videos with a special approach: first, i using the Adobe After Effects, I cut out characters for further editing, and then add unique sound and video effects. Also, I use free images from google on the background in my locations in the video.<br />All my video features materials protected by the Fair Use guidelines of Section 107 of Copyright Act. It takes about 2 hours to create these videos so that my viewers can feel the difference between the original video and the video I created.<br /><br />‚ùóÔ∏è The audio and video sources in this video were created in such a way that the viewer hears and sees the new UNIQUE content.<br /><br />Official YouTube Channel, where I taken the Pocoyo scenes for this video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/POCOYOUSA">https://www.youtube.com/user/POCOYOUSA</a><br /><br />#pocoyo #soundvariations‚Äã‚Äã #pocoyosoundvariations #soundvariationsin30seconds #meme #memes #soundeffect{% endraw %}
