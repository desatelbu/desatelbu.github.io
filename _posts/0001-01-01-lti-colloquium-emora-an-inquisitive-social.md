{% raw %}Speaker: Jinho Choi @ Emory University<br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~choi/">http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~choi/</a><br />Title: Emora: An Inquisitive Social Chatbot Who Cares for You<br />Abstract: Dr. Choi presents technology behind the Conversational AI-based chatbot called Emora, that was awarded the first place in this yearâ€™s Alexa Prize Socialbot Grand Challenge. Emora is premised on the notions of active curiosity and caring, and brings opinion and feeling to Conversational AI, which had mostly been information-based and task-oriented. After interacting with Emora, we want you to have the feel of talking to a close friend rather than being served by an information kiosk. This talk begins by demonstrating limitations on the current state-of-the-art chatbots and compares user experiences from information-based, opinion-based, and experience-based dialogue managements observed during the Alexa Prize. Emora is based on the Emory State Transition Dialogue Manager that facilitates the design of engaging dialogue flows with complex probabilistic finite-state machines. Key features such as topic handling, user profiling, and personality development are also discussed.<br /><br />#NLProc Natural Language Processing #MachineLearning CMU LTI{% endraw %}
