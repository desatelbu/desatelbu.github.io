{% raw %}University of Utah Health and The Rockefeller University has been conducting research in this stream for quite some time now. A startling discovery has been made unexpectedly by an evolutionary geneticist in the Department of Human Genetics at University of Utah Health by the name Nels Elde. They have determined how a genetic mutation found in mice and monkeys interferes with viruses such as HIV and Ebola. They say the finding could eventually lead to the development of medical interventions in humans.{% endraw %}
