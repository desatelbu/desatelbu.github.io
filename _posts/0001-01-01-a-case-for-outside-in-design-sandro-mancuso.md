But what are the pros and cons of this approach? Are there other alternatives?<br />In this presentation, Sandro will discuss different design biases and how business analysis can impact architecture. He will then focus on Outside-In Design, explaining how the domain model, bounded contexts and [micro] services can emerge and evolve when driven by the needs [...]<br /><br />Download slides and read the full abstract here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gotochgo.com/2019/sessions/707/a-case-for-outside-in-design">https://gotochgo.com/2019/sessions/707/a-case-for-outside-in-design</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/GOTOchgo">https://twitter.com/GOTOchgo</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-">https://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference">https://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference</a><br />#SoftwareArchitecture #DDD #Microserivces<br /><br />Looking for a unique learning experience?<br />Attend the next GOTO Conference near you!
