{% raw %}After looking at Saw traps that were extremely difficult to win, we're going to look at the easiest. Throughout the franchise we've all seen traps that made us think &quot;I can do that&quot; and while we're lucky enough to not be in that situation it does make you think that you can win this one. In this video we'll count down these traps and decide which one (or 2) are the easiest out of all the 9 movies.{% endraw %}
