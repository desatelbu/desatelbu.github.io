{% raw %}Only to worsen substantially from 9 PM to 12 PM peaking to a PM2.5 reading of over 100 at 5:30 AM.<br /><br />At near to 12 PM, the air in my neighborhood gets much cleaner. The reading was 51-53 in my bedroom just at 11 AM earlier and it was 48 downstairs and ranged between 37 and 41 in the streets around my neighborhood. Near 12 PM however, the reading went to 30-33 in my bedroom which is HEALTHY. So, whatever the source of this pollution is near and of SINGLE SOURCE. They ramp up the pollution gradually from 9 PM peaking it while people are asleep and wind it down a bit from 6 AM and then winding it down further from 9 AM and STOPPING it altogether at 12 PM. This is every day.<br /><br />This shows that it is NOT ambient pollution that has been causing our severe air pollution problem. Rather, the source is near i.e., localized and is most probably of a single source or some sources under the command of a single man or organization. In short, we ARE BEING POISONED, locally. Neighbors with Rolls Royce don't even realize this. This is also why people to the north don't have the same issue, AT ALL. Their air is clean or normal. Before I began recording all this, the smell would be localized to our home too at 3 AM to 5 AM which is weird.<br /><br />If you sit next to a bonfire of trash or ash, the PM 2.5 reading would be 40 within a meter as long as the smoke doesn't blow into you directly. If it does, the reading goes to 600.<br /><br />#airpollution #jakarta #kayuputih #pulogebang{% endraw %}
