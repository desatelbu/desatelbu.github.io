This is why newborns and babies sleep so much, as their bodies and brains actually recuperate some necessary energy while they are asleep.<br /><br />★ Sleeping helps the immune system<br />★ Sleeping deletes irrelevant memories you have stored up<br />★ Sleeping will also help you to integrate old information you already hold with new information you are learning.<br />★ Sleeping will help you avoid psychosis<br />★ Sleeping is good for your metabolism<br />★ Sleep helps to reduce stress<br />★ Sleep may reduce risk of depression<br /><br /><br />★ About Meditation: <br />Meditation is about developing our awareness through mindful practice. It is about finding the stillness that leads to mental clarity, calmness, and physical healing. It allows us to experience all our faculties as a whole person.<br />In life, most things are beyond our control. The only domain that we have influence over, is ourselves, our reaction and action. The world becomes a better place when we can react to it with more self-awareness. For this to happen, we must first cultivate ourselves, and there is no better way to do this than with meditation.<br /><br /><br /><br />★ Royalty Free Music License - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/38l2C4T">https://bit.ly/38l2C4T</a><br /><br /><br />★ About Us: <br /><br />We love to provide you with self composed therapeutic, healing, meditation &amp; sleep music. <br /><br />We are a channel that promotes sleep, healing, meditation, personal and spiritual growth.<br /><br />We sincerely want our listeners and viewers to get real value out of visiting our channel.<br /><br /><br />Welcome to our channel.<br /><br />Personal Power - Sleep Serenity &amp; Meditation<br /><br /><br />All rights reserved.
