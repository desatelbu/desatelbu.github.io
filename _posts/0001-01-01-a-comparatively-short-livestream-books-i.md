{% raw %}Hello lovelies! Here's a comparatively short livestream in which I talk about the books I'm currently reading, did a little AMA (Ask Me Anything), and gave you a few channel updates. I also talked about a few blog updates. If you'd like to follow me there, the link is down below. :)<br /><br />(Don't be surprised at the number of books I'm currently reading. Miracles do happen sometimes. XD)<br /><br />If you're new here and you like this video, please check out my other videos.
