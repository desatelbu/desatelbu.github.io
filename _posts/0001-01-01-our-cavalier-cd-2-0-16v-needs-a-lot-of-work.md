{% raw %}Dougie bought this Cavalier CD in 2013 to get the dash and door cards out it for his GSi. It became apparent it was way too nice to use as a donor car so it was fitted with a SRi interior. Kenzo then bought it, a C20XE was fitted and then it was sold on again. Dougie then bought it back in 2015 with head gasket failure, fixed it up and put it on the road.<br />Since then it's climbed from 106,000 miles to almost 160,000. But now in 2021 it needs a lot of work: all new rear brakes, several plates of welding, a timing belt, clutch, brake pipes and more. There are exciting plans for the car during the Christmas holidays so the race it on to get it finished. This is the first part of... dunno how many videos on it! Also, the two post ramp saga is here too which you may have seen on social media. Enjoy!{% endraw %}
