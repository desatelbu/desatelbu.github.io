{% raw %}Jon Lovett covers this week's news live from Cinelounge Outdoors in Hollywood! Then he gets into Rudy Giuliani's chaotic tweets and speculates Dumbledore's secrets. A huge thank you to Rory O’Malley for singing this week's opening number.<br /><br />Subscribe to our channel! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/crookedmedia?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/crookedmedia?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.<br /><br />Want some pep talks, the most important things to do/know, and the occasional dog pic?
