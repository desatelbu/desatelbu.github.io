And if you understand how a Ponzi scheme works, then you're not too far off. Those who are working - GIVE to the scheme, and those who are retired RECEIVE from the scheme, this is a form of a Ponzi scheme no matter how you dress it up<br /><br />So here's the main problems that almost no one is talking about... <br />Pension plans globally are heavily invested in risky assets. This is how they are able to get such high returns. The fixed-income aspect has been steadily declining for years<br /><br />And remember, the more profit the fund makes, the more the asset managers make in commission. <br /><br />Over 10,000 baby boomers retire every day<br /><br />By 2030, all baby boomers will be over the age of 65, Meaning that between now and 2030, the youngest baby boomers will be selling their assets in a period of economic stagnation or worse, economic recession, achieving lower prices upon asset sales<br /><br />In the 1950s, there were 7 workers to support every 1 retiree receiving a pension: 7:1 / 2000s 5:1 / 2030: 2:1 / 2050: 1.5:1 - However the program would be bankrupt long before 2050 came around<br /><br />In most western Nations, estimates are that the pension programs will go bankrupt between 2025-2032<br /><br />In the United States, the public pension system lost $1 trillion due to the lockdowns in March 2020<br /><br />Many state and local pensions were already facing a $4.1 trillion shortfall. This equates to an unfunded public liability of $32k per household! <br /><br />In The United Kingdom, a Government review said: “without any additional support in addition to National Insurance Contributions, the Fund balance will fall rapidly to exhaustion in around 2032.”<br /><br />If we’re 30-40% underfunded right now, what do you think will happen when we move into this next financial crash? It will probably go to 60-70% underfunded<br /><br />When it comes to fund managers, they are charging excessive fees and the Government officials are just agreeing to it, because it’s not their money!<br /><br />The labour Force participation rate for people over sixty-five is going up. Boomers are now competing with younger people for jobs<br /> <br />So what are the solutions to this enormous problem then? <br />Well, the obvious mathematical solution is also Unthinkable. You reduce the population of older people, a complete non-starter. Which leads us on to three possible solutions:<br /><br />1. Allow a mass influx of young working age people from poorer nations who would be willing to do the hard jobs, thereby paying into the pension programs. I certainly don't think this is a good idea, but this could explain why many Western governments are allowing so much immigration into their countries right now. <br />2. Increase the state pension age, however, this is discrimination against the poorest in society, who live up to 10 years shorter than the richest in society <br />3. Stop allowing lobbyists to negotiate final salary pensions such as what happens in California and New York, because this drains the fund for future generations. <br /><br />To conclude then, none of the solutions here are going to work - meaning that these pension funds are a ticking time bomb, just waiting to implode. There simply aren’t enough workers<br /><br />DISCLAIMER<br />This video is for entertainment purposes ONLY &amp; designed to help your thinking, not direct it.
