{% raw %}Agriculture Minister David Littleproud says a deal will not be struck until a detailed plan is shown to the Nationals on getting to net-zero emissions by 2050 and the impact it will have on regional Australia before coming to a conclusion. <br /><br />Nationals MPs held a virtual party room meeting on Monday to discuss the prospect of net-zero for Australia, as Prime Minister Scott Morrison attempts to secure support from the party.  <br /><br />“I think the vast majority of the party room are being pragmatic and want to see the details of the plan before they make a determination; I think that’s the responsible thing to do,” Mr Littleproud told Sky News Australia. <br /><br />“Regional Australia, footed the bill for much of what’s been achieved in us meeting our international commitments, we want to make sure there’s no more pain. <br /><br />“But we also take great comfort from what the Prime Minister has said is that the plan has to protect regional Australians and therefore we take him on his words.”{% endraw %}
