{% raw %}The song is based on the essence of Nature and its preservation. It highlights in particular, the Natural Aspects of Goa which are slowly but surely compromised in order to make way to infrastructure and concrete Jungles.<br /><br />The song gives an in-depth view of the dangers of deforestation and doing away of mountains. It emphasises the colossal damage that can cause the extinction of flora and fauna and their habitats and the subsequent adverse effects on human dwelling.<br /><br />An emotion plea is made to Goans locally and across the global diaspora to maintain the bond and attachment we once shared among our fellow Goans,  to stand united and be the voice against the corrupt practices and take up the cause to preserve and protect our Goa.{% endraw %}
