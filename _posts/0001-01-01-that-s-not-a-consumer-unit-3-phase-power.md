{% raw %}This consumer unit is enormous compared to the unit usually installed within UK homes. This is a house with a difference. It's the first major housing development to be supplied with three-phase power as part of the Western Power Distribution (WPD) low carbon technology strategy.<br /><br />This two-bedroom house is being kitted out with low carbon technologies that we expect to be commonplace as we move away from gas heating. In this video, we explore the first fix electrical installation for PV, battery storage, ground source heat pumps and EV charger.<br /><br />See the completed installation 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/jVVaUhFZb_o">https://youtu.be/jVVaUhFZb_o</a><br /><br />This is installation is part of the Parc Eirin project by POBL Homes.
