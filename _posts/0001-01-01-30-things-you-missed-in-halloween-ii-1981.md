Despite Halloween II picking up right where the original left off, the film was actually the work of a new director, Rick Rosenthal, who would try to emulate the style established in the first one by John Carpenter. <br /><br />Not only are there a lot of callbacks and easter eggs referencing the original movie, but we also have plenty of other material to analyze, from the new theme of this movie regarding dreams and nightmares, to new crew reference easter eggs, to some text located on the back of a newspaper.<br /><br />In this video I am once again joined by @Jimmy Champane as we analyze the original Halloween sequel, talk about the themes and meaning of the ending and break down every detail you might have overlooked!<br /><br />#Halloween #HalloweenKills #sponsored<br /><br />Chapters<br />0:00 | The Festival Samhain<br />1:20 | Intro<br />2:20 | Mr. Sandman Bring Me A Dream<br />3:43 | Halloween 1 Callbacks<br />4:31 | Dr. Dementia's Horror Movie Marathon Deep Dive<br />5:05 | Bedsheet Motif<br />5:39 |  Nancy Loomis / Kyes Cameo<br />6:18 | BetterHelp Sponsorship<br />7:20 | The Pirate Costume Kid<br />8:20 | Crew Reference Easter Eggs<br />8:49 | Russellville Again<br />9:14 | The Backstory of Ben Tramer<br />10:14 | Text Hidden on Newspaper<br />10:49 | The ACTUAL Meaning of Michael's Drawing<br />11:43 | I Have Some Questions About This Movie...<br />13:03 | How The Ending Is An Allegory For A Druid Ritual<br />14:04 | We're All Afraid Of The Dark Inside Of Ourselves<br />14:56 | The End of Michael Myers<br /><br />--About Halloween Kills--<br />The Halloween night when Michael Myers returned isnâ€™t over yet. Minutes after Laurie Strode (Curtis), her daughter Karen (Judy Greer) and granddaughter Allyson (Andi Matichak) left masked monster Michael Myers caged and burning in Laurieâ€™s basement, Laurie is rushed to the hospital with life-threatening injuries, believing she finally killed her lifelong tormentor. But when Michael manages to free himself from Laurieâ€™s trap, his ritual bloodbath resumes.
