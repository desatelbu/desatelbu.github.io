{% raw %}Unresolved trauma festers like a flesh-eating bacteria on a wound. The longer it stays unattended to, the deeper it eats into the soul of the host. Muthoni Gitau, an African content creator and DIY queen knows this all too well. After a traumatic violation, Muthoni  thought she could suppress the pain and for years, sought ways to numb it with alcohol. This only led to more pain. A caring friend and a therapist have helped her begin dealing with the layers of pain. Now she doesnâ€™t need to hide behind red lipstick. In this candid and courageous story, we are encouraged to feel and deal with our pain to heal. <br />#depression #mentalhealth #trauma <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD-Mf4F5ZQ1Jw-?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD-Mf4F5ZQ1Jw-?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Engage provides a platform for ordinary and extraordinary people to Inform.
