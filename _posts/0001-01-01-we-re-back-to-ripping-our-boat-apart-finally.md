{% raw %}Our Sailboat has No Prop, No Rudder and now it's time to Launch! Annnnd we have given ourselves 3 days to launch because we're ready to be ON THE WATER! So buckle up because it's go time. <br /><br />Our once salvaged sailboat has been sitting on the hard through the winter. It's summer now, and time to hit the ocean. We have a couple of big projects before it's safe to launch again. Mainly the fact that our prop shaft was leaking and needed to be serviced. <br /><br />A HUGE thank you to all who have been supporting us this past year. We bought our dream boat 1 year ago and have been posting these videos now for almost as long. We are about to hit one of our huge milestones of 100k subscribers and we literally would not be here if it wasn't for you. Thank you!<br /><br />With love<br />The Evans'<br /><br /><br />****************************************<br />*Our Boat*<br />2008 Beneteau 49<br />3 cabin 2 head<br />4JH4-TE <br />Westerbeke generator<br />Mast, sails and rig are in excellent condition and in storage<br />Here's what we *think* we know about her past. Keep in mind we bought her at auction without ever meeting the owner! The owner was sailing along and ran aground - hard. Hard enough that the keel pivoted and pushed the aft end up into the hull. This force cracked the internal grid in several places and broke a portion of the grid free from hull. At some point an inspection was done, insurance was called and decisions were made.
