{% raw %}Most Super Mario 64 Speedrun TAS rely on one key mechanic - LBLJs. So, how will this SM64 70 star TAS tackle not being able to use them? <br /><br />N64 Super Mario 64 &quot;70 Stars BLJless&quot; in 42:58:52 ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV7nJwt2zhc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV7nJwt2zhc</a><br /><br />merch ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://simply64store.com/">https://simply64store.com/</a><br />twitch ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitch.tv/simply">https://twitch.tv/simply</a><br />twitter ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/SIMPLYN64">https://www.twitter.com/SIMPLYN64</a><br />soundcloud ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/simply64">https://soundcloud.com/simply64</a><br /><br />Edited by oknem<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/theoknem">https://twitter.com/theoknem</a><br /><br />OUTRO SONG ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/simply64/balls-in-ranch">https://soundcloud.com/simply64/balls-in-ranch</a><br /><br />Simply reacts to a SM64 70 star TAS speedrun. I wonder how the Mario 64 70 Star WR will get to the TAS. Different speedrunning strategies appear over time, such as Chip Clip and framewalk sm64, so you never know. Mario 64 Speedrunner reacts to DS Version Speedrun is gaining some traction recently, so I'll just pop it here.<br /><br />gleasn is a cool guy. Did you know about gleasn? He does the title, description and thumbnails for Simply's YouTube channel. Simply streams all sorts of things like Super Mario 64, Minecraft and more, sometimes with people like Mizkif and Ludwig. Mizkif is probably better than this TAS, but Simply is pretty good at Super Mario 64. He doesn't like Super Mario Odyssey very much though. Anyway, without gleasn this channel wouldn't actually exist, so if you see this please type &quot;thank you gleasn&quot; in the comments. I wonder if gleasn will actually keep this keyword dump or if he will remove it for an actual one. Because I'm oknem, not gleasn. Oops. ((thank you oknem ❤️))<br /><br />#sm64 #speedrun #mario{% endraw %}
