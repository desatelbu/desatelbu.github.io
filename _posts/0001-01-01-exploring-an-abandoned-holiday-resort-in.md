We soon find out it is not really a hospital and not that green either. Instead, it is a brutalist holiday resort built in the mountains that happens to have an infirmary. <br /><br />Check out @Broken Window Theory's channel as well!<br />Their video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/se7rMzIHzVw">https://youtu.be/se7rMzIHzVw</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://theproperpeople.com">http://theproperpeople.com</a><br /><br />JOIN US ON:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/theproperpeople">http://facebook.com/theproperpeople</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/theproperpeople">http://twitter.com/theproperpeople</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/theproperpeople">http://instagram.com/theproperpeople</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/theproperpeople">https://www.reddit.com/r/theproperpeople</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tiktok.com/@theproperpeople">https://tiktok.com/@theproperpeople</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/theproperpeople">https://discord.gg/theproperpeople</a><br /><br />Thanks to Musicbed for providing the music in this video.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://share.mscbd.fm/theproperpeople">http://share.mscbd.fm/theproperpeople</a> (Affiliate Link)<br /><br />Intro Music: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://artist.landr.com/music/672985173835">https://artist.landr.com/music/672985173835</a><br /><br />Enjoying our videos?
