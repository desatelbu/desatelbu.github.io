{% raw %}This channel is about our daily life raising our 2 boys and our daughter who has Down Syndrome. <br /><br />When we first found out about Eva's diagnosis we couldn't find many YouTube channels from families in the same situation, which is why we decided to start this channel.<br /><br /><br /><br />We are just a simple, average family sharing the joys (and sometimes the challenges) that raising a child with Down Syndrome have brought to our life!{% endraw %}
