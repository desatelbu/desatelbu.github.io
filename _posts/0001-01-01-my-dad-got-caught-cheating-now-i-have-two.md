Before the polyamorous relationship started, Alex and Shalaun had been married for nearly 20 years with two children. But when Shalaun discovered Alex's affair with Shantell, it rocked their marriage. Shalaun eventually decided to meet Shantell and to everyone's surprise, the three of them hit it off straight away. After reassessing their relationship, they started exploring the idea of polygamy. The throuple's decision to stay together was initially met with resistance from the family. They also regularly get judgement online for their relationship. Four years later, the throuple is still happily in love and dedicated to building their family together - Alex and Shantell welcomed their first daughter last year, bringing them to a family of six.  Shalaun told Truly: 'We started off in a rocky position but we grew to know each other and learn how to love each other in different ways and different fashions.' <br /><br />Follow the Portah family here:<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/portahfamily/">https://instagram.com/portahfamily/</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/portahfamily">https://www.facebook.com/portahfamily</a><br />YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/PorterFamily">https://www.youtube.com/c/PorterFamily</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thepanelenm.com">https://www.thepanelenm.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.theportahfamily.com">https://www.theportahfamily.com</a><br /><br />Videographer: Trent Wittenbach<br />Producers: Emilia Jiang, Ruby Coote <br />Editor: Alex Lubetkin<br /><br />Truly is on TikTok! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show">https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show</a><br /><br />Now you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES">http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES</a><br /><br />Click here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! <br />Truly - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow">https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow</a><br />Born Different - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/">https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/</a><br />Shake My Beauty - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/">https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/</a><br />Hooked On The Look - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/">https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/</a><br />Love Don't Judge - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/">https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/</a><br />Beastly - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/">https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/</a><br />Ridiculous Rides - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/">https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/</a><br />Dog Dynasty - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/">https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/</a><br /><br />For more amazing content, click here!<br />Beastly: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA</a><br />Barcroft Cars: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured">https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured</a>{% endraw %}
