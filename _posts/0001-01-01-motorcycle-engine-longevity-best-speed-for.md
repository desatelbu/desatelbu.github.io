{% raw %}The Himalayan is a great all round motorcycle but perhaps it's best at home on the green lanes and the country roads and not the Motorways!<br />In the 1940's  there was this automotive engineer by the name of Laurence Pomeroy.<br />He came up with a standard called the &quot;Pomeroy Dictum&quot;. The Pomeroy Dictum states that for good longevity, the piston speeds in an internal combustion engine should remain under 2500 feet per minute.<br />It's an old standard, but some say it is still relevant today !<br />Race engines generally run much higher piston speeds compared to normal road riders but then a race engine is rebuilt regularly, we want our engines to last so riding them conservatively not only save on fuel but decreases pollution and noise and gives our bikes a longer life.<br />Using the Pomeroy Dictum I show you how to apply a simple formula to work out the best RPM for your particular bike.<br />I don't think it does too much harm to occasionally exceed these recommended RPM values as I have done it many times on my bikes with no negative effects so far but generally I do ride conservatively.<br /><br />Music used in this video is from the YouTube audio library   <br />Track title Communicator<br />Artist Reed Mathis<br />Thanks<br />for watching{% endraw %}
