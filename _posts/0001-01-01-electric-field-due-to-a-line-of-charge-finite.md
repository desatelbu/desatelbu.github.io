{% raw %}This physics video tutorial explains how to calculate the electric field due to a line of charge of finite length.  It also explains the concept of linear charge density and how to calculate it using an equation that contains the total charge and length of the rod..  It shows you how to evaluate the definite integrals using calculus techniques such as  U-substitution and trigonometric substitution in order to derive the formula to calculate the net electric field along the x axis and along the y-axis.  This video contains a few examples and practice problems.{% endraw %}
