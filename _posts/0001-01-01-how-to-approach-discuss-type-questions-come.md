{% raw %}Come on over to <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://teachingbubble.com/blog/how-to-approac...cuss-questions">http://teachingbubble.com/blog/how-to-approac...cuss-questions</a> where the main discussion happens and you can get feedback on the answer to the question.<br /><br />Learning the content is only half the battle.<br /><br />So often students know everything there is to know about a particular topic yet don't answer the question that is put in front of them. It is crucial that you know what terms such as 'discuss' mean.<br /><br />Knowing how to approach questions that have 'discuss' in them will help many students receive better marks. <br /><br />Discuss means to look at both sides of the argument or issue. If you are going to talk about the benefits then you need to also talk about the weaknesses. This is how you show both sides. <br /><br />Coming up with a conclusion doesn't hurt your answer either. For example: if you are discussing an appropriate management structure you should recommend one such as Divisional. Then talk about the benefits of an organisation using a divisional structure. <br /><br />You then need to talk about the weaknesses or drawback of using a divisional structure. And then it is a good idea to conclude your answer as to why the divisional is the most appropriate.<br /><br />Good luck in your studies and...<br /><br />Thanks for watching.{% endraw %}
