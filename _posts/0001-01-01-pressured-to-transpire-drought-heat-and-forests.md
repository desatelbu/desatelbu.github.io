{% raw %}VPD (Vapor Pressure Deficit) is one of the main forces governing plant transpiration. Its recent increase as a consequence of climate change is a matter of concern for forests, even in humid, tropical climates as high VPD might exacerbate forest mortality.<br />Disentangling the effects of VPD from those of other factors such as heat and drought is a new challenge for scientists worldwide. This is precisely the aim of this high-end project conducted by Prof. Charlotte Grossiord  at four sites in Switzerland, capitalizing on the human competences and exceptional research infrastructure of SwissForestLab.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://swissforestlab.wsl.ch">https://swissforestlab.wsl.ch</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epfl.ch/labs/perl/">https://www.epfl.ch/labs/perl/</a><br /><br />About the video:<br />Scientific supervision: Prof. Charlotte Grossiord (WSL/EPFL)<br />Direction: Hannah Dobbertin (Lumatics)<br />Camera, editing: Elia Grunder (Lumatics)<br />Camera assistant: Damian Ruchti (Lumatics)<br />Micro-CT 3D images: Gary Perrenoud (EPFL)<br />VDP and gross productivity model outputs: Achilleas Psomas (WSL)<br />Animation: Damian Ruchti (Lumatics), Noah Rakic<br />Sound design: Philipp Erdmann<br />Voice: Jy Prishkulnik<br />Music: The Racer, Tristan Barton / Artlist<br />Concept and production: Mich√®le Kaennel Dobbertin (WSL) for SwissForestLab<br /><br />#vaporpressuredeficit <br />#climatechange<br />#ecophysiology<br />#PIXE{% endraw %}
