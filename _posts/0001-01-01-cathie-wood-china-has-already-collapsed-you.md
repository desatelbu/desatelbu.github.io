And while that may all come true eventually, the reality is that China seems to be following a path similar to Japan, as opposed to the United States. The world once believed that Japan was destined to do what China is seeking to do today, but it all fell apart, as the entire country fell into a 30 year long economic disaster that started with a real estate bubble. Well, it's my belief, and Cathie Woodâ€™s belief as well, that China has already crashed, that this disaster has already started, and that it's just a matter of time until the world realises what is really going on. Today, Iâ€™m going to show you my deep dive into the reality that is the Chinese economy, and the reasons why its collapse has already begun. <br /><br />DISCLAIMERS:<br />Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for &quot;fair use&quot; for purposes such as criticism, commenting, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
