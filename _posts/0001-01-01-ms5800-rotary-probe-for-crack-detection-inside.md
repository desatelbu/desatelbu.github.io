{% raw %}A rotary probe designed to simultaneously detect longitudinal and axial cracks in the tubesheet can be used with the MS5800 and Multiview through the Minimite and dedicated adapters. The rotary probe is very simple and quick to inspect when connected to the N500 or N600. Cracks in the tubesheet are difficult to detect with a normal bobbin probe. Therefore, NDT inspectors need special probes (MRPC, +Point MRPC, SPNR) or bobbin-type multi-array probes. However, since these probes and rotating accessories are very expensive, the initial investment and maintenance costs are very high, which limits the application of heat exchanger tube inspection of various tube sizes in petrochemical plants. To solve this problem, we developed a rotating eddy current probe for crack detection inside tubesheet years ago. If you have a N500D, N600D, MS5800-E and a minimite, you're ready to use it. With the MS5800 and Multiview, you can check the direction of defects in real time with C-Scan images. We hope this information will help your business.{% endraw %}
