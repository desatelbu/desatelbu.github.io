{% raw %}Welcome to Movie Shortens. Today I am going to explain and recap a movie titled 247F (2011). Trapped in a sauna due to a mystery reason, the friends need to get out, but all they can do is wait! Wait for what, wait for who?! How long could you wait in the heat up to 250 degree Fahrenheit? Would they make it to survive??<br /><br />Subscribe for more Movie Recaps: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3k3TitI">https://bit.ly/3k3TitI</a><br /><br />Thanks for watching!{% endraw %}
