{% raw %}Today on our Off Grid Homestead my wife Heather and I are working On our Post and Beam building. It's a slow go battling the freezing rain and the snow but...we do manage to get one rafter up in place.  If my calculations are correct our roof pitch is close to 7/12 or a 30 degree slope....this will be a good slope for our snow conditions up here.{% endraw %}
