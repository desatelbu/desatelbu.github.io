{% raw %}Composed for Young Women Composers Camp Online 2020*<br />Premiered on July 29th, 2020<br />Rebekah Heller, bassoon<br /><br />“when pneum is named”, for bassoon and fixed media, is an exploration of dualities that manifest in my identity and spirituality.  The name derives from the second statement in the Dao De Jing, which roughly translated is “The Name that is named is not the eternal Name&quot;.  (&quot;Pneum&quot; echoes the Greek pneuma, meaning &quot;wind, breath, spirit&quot;.)<br /><br />The score is a video that pans through a graphic I created that provides instructions and stimuli for the bassoonist to respond to.  The bassoonist listens to the fixed media when performing and allows it to further guide their creativity.<br /><br />*Young Women Composers Camp is a summer music composition program for high school students who identify as women or nonbinary persons. In 2020, the program was virtual and included college students.  For more information, go to www.youngwomencomposers.org{% endraw %}
