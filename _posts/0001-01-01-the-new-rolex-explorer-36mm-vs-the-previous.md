However, other than the change in size, the new Explorer seemed more or less the same as the older variant. So what I wanted to do was to do a side-by-side comparison of the outgoing 214270 and the new 124270. They are of course very similar watches at the end of the day, but for me, they make two totally different statements. <br /><br />My List Videos Playlist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLja3u80DBmCoUrBJEwH2F7akvTnCvIWnI">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLja3u80DBmCoUrBJEwH2F7akvTnCvIWnI</a><br />Other Places to Check Out:<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/teddybaldassarre/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/teddybaldassarre/?hl=en</a>{% endraw %}
