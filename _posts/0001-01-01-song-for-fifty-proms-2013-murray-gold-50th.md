'This is a creature we can understand, a living being it is just being If we could find what's on its mind then perhaps<br /><br />We might survive.'<br /><br />And as we stumble down our slow road I can't but wonder what would it be like. To run away with you through time, where would we go who might we find. But on we go, cutting our paths, only one way, one day ot a time, while you embrace the universe, spinning your way on the fast road, limitless endless.<br /><br />So my dear friend you're getting kinda old now (or maybe we are). And now our children watch you do the deeds we marvelled at wondered at. From the jaws of disaster, from a planet besieged by deadly ancient foes.<br /><br />It's not the end yet there is no end.<br /><br />Fumbling and bumbling while all around is crumbling and stumbling through time like you're a mad man still it's humbling to watch you reconcile divergent creeds without succumbing to the lure of weapons, force or greed you only use intelligence and jokes and charm.<br /><br />Happy birthday. Doctor. You.{% endraw %}
