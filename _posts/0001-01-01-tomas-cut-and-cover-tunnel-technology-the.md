{% raw %}The TOMAS Surface Tunneling technology is based on three innovations:<br /><br />1. Building a semi circular tunnel from the surface in soils with high water table without draining or pumping out the sub-surface water.<br />2. Removing the soil mixed with water within a half round shield with standard cutter dredging technology adapted for this application.<br />3. Using standard segmented tunneling sections to shape the tunnel, but fixing these segments with post-tensioning under a continuous precast or cast on site concrete beam fixed and supported or held by rakes of piles.<br /><br />Benefits of this technology are:<br /><br />- Short construction time because of fast building (50-80 mtrs/day)<br />- Low investment cost<br />- Limited construction space required<br />- No ground dewatering required<br />- Soil removal by dredging is the cheapest way of moving soil<br />- Material transport can be done through finished tunnel<br />- Minimum impact on the environment<br />- Use is made of well-known technologies<br />- Innovative construction method with international potential<br /><br />Current contact for technology licensing:<br />Ing.
