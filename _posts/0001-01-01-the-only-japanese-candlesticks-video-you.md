It was invented by Japanese rice merchants centuries ago, and popularised among Western traders by a broker called Steve Nison in the 1990s. <br /><br />How to read Japanese candlestick patterns<br />To read Japanese candlestick patterns, you'll need to familiarise yourself with three elements on each candle: <br /><br />On most charts today, green candlesticks indicate upward movement and red ones a move down. However, occasionally white (up) and black (down) is used instead<br />On a green candle, the top of the body is the close and the bottom is the open. On a red one, the opposite is true<br />On both red and green sticks, the top of the wick (sometimes called the shadow) is the highest point that the market has hit within the period – and the bottom is the lowest<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />⚠️ NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE DISCLAIMER: <br />We have done our best to ensure that the information provided here and the resources available for download are accurate and provide valuable information.
