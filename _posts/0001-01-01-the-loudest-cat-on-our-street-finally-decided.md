{% raw %}The Loud Cat was once the loudest cat on our street with her incredibly loud meowing sounds; but a while ago, she finally decided to calm down and be quiet from then on.. And the whole neighborhood breathed a sigh of relief..<br /><br />My email address: waltersantindy@gmail.com<br />Our Instagram page: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/waltersantindy">https://www.instagram.com/waltersantindy</a><br />Our second channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/FeedandTravel">https://www.youtube.com/FeedandTravel</a><br /><br />About Our Channel:<br />This channel is about the daily lives and adventures of my 3 indoor cats Santi, Indy &amp; Chewie and our 13 outdoor cats and my dog Walter.<br />Our outdoor cats are living in our garden and their names are D'Artagnan, The Rolling Cat (Princess), The Purring Cat, D'Artagnan's Girlfriend, Porthos, Zoom, Junior, The Mom Cat, The Big Head, Ruzgar, Nope, Pamuk and Pamuk Jr.<br />If you are a new visitor to our channel, I suggest that you watch the two playlists called &quot;All The Videos of Our Outdoor Cats (In Order)&quot; and &quot;All The Videos of My Indoor Cats (In Order)&quot; first.<br />Apart from the videos of our cats, from time to time I also upload videos of other animals I come across.<br />So basically, what you'll find here are lots of funny and cute cat videos, an ongoing miniseries about a cat love drama, sometimes rescue stories and always a whole lot of meowing!
