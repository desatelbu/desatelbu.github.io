{% raw %}I've been to Shin-Okubo in autumn.<br />As usual, it is a popular city for young women.<br />Korean idols are also popular, and many women enjoyed shopping at idol shops.<br />So many people on this day that I had a hard time walking.<br />Shin-Okubo is the best Korean town in Tokyo.There is also a street named &quot;Handsome Street&quot; where many good-looking men work in restaurants. This is the main reason why many women come here.{% endraw %}
