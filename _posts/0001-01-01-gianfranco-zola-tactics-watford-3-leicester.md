There was more to this win than mere emotion, though, and Zola explains how he set his team up to beat a side that would go on to be Premier League champions within three years, as well as his memories of and reaction to that 97th-minute Deeney winner.<br /> <br />The Coaches‚Äô Voice<br /> <br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://coachesvoice.com">https://coachesvoice.com</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/CoachesVoice">https://twitter.com/CoachesVoice</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/CoachesVoice">https://facebook.com/CoachesVoice</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/CoachesVoice">https://instagram.com/CoachesVoice</a><br /> <br />The Coaches‚Äô Voice Academy<br /> <br />Subscribe today: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://academy.coachesvoice.com/join">https://academy.coachesvoice.com/join</a><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://academy.coachesvoice.com">https://academy.coachesvoice.com</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/cv_academy">https://twitter.com/cv_academy</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/cv_academy">https://instagram.com/cv_academy</a><br />Join our coaching forum: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/31BuDA3">http://bit.ly/31BuDA3</a><br /> <br />#GianfrancoZola #WatfordFC #Masterclass{% endraw %}
