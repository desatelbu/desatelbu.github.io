{% raw %}Tim is a geochemist and palaeoceanographer. He is currently doing post-doctoral research at ETH Zürich in Switzerland. In his TEDxTalk, Tim will show that while the ongoing changes to the Earth’s environment are unprecedented in the relatively short history of humankind, Earth’s history can help us make sense of our current conditions. By highlighting a few key events in the long (over 4.5 billion year) but turbulent history of the Earth, he will offer us a historical perspective to our current living conditions and the ongoing environmental change.
