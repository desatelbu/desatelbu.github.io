{% raw %}Riding my huge portable kicker ramp - Urban MTB freeride on my custom Haibike dirt jump bike is the best! I take my MTB Hopper ramp in my truck to hit sick urban spots and send big tricks, would you ride this? <br /><br />The MTB hopper ramp is the best thing ever for setting up crazy urban MTB freeride lines and slopestyle features in random locations around town's and cities so I do just that and take my bike around with my big American truck and find sick spots to ride with the ramp and also without it on this last day of riding before I head to New York for the How I see it movie that I will create! The first spot we arrive at isn't the best option, but of course I make the most and land some banger tricks before finding the worst pump track ever made and a slide ride! After this we find a dangerous option that I send a few high consequence tricks on and get some cool shots. From here we then hit a number of other MTB freeride locations before finishing at a skatepark that I had to light with a generator and lights!!! <br /><br />I hope you enjoy the video!<br /><br /><br /><br />MERCH:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tothesky.store/">https://www.tothesky.store/</a><br /><br /><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br /><br /><br />Welcome to my channel, I'm a professional Freeride Mountain biker and former FMB world champion(2013).  <br /><br /><br /><br />This channel is all about Mountain biking, I make a huge variety of videos for everyone who loves dirt: From downhill biking to slower paced trials riding and everything in between like dirt jumping, slopestyle and enduro!  <br /><br /><br /><br />As well as making entertaining videos(I hope) I also like to help YOU out too, with videos such as:  <br /><br />- How to ride better <br /><br />- Trick tips and How to's <br /><br />- Travel VLOGS <br /><br />- GoPro camera tips <br /><br />- In-depth entertaining features <br /><br />- POV craziness <br /><br />- Funny videos <br /><br /><br /><br /> I also try to reply to everyone so leave some comments too!{% endraw %}
