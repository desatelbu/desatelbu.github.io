{% raw %}In this day and age, we are either offending those around us with uncouth words or we‚Äôve been offended by those we thought we could trust. If we‚Äôre offended, God will protect us from their stinging words and biting tongues and alleviate their weight from our souls. If we‚Äôre offending, the Lord will purge our spirits of our internal iniquities and restore us to a loving heart and open hand. In both instances, we prevent offense by forgiving one another ‚Äî just as Christ forgave us on the cross! Turn that offense into a defense that gets you out of your feelings and into your faith!<br /><br />Message: ‚ÄúDefense Against Offenses: Get Out of Your Feelings‚Äù<br />Scripture: Luke 17:1-10 (KJV)<br />Speaker: Bishop T.D.
