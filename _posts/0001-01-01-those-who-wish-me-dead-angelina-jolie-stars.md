{% raw %}Angelina Jolie stars as Hannah, a smoke jumper reeling from the loss of three young lives she failed to save from a fire. When she comes across a bloodied and traumatized 12-year-old boy, they set out together to cross the miles of thick forest with two assassins in pursuit.  Braving deadly lightning storms that threaten even Hannahâ€™s well-honed survival skills, they are caught between two relentless killers hunting the boy from one direction, and a massive fiery blaze coming straight for them, quickly consuming everything in their path.{% endraw %}
