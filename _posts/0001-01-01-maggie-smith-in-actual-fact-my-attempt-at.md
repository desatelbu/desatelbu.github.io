{% raw %}I've noticed that Maggie Smith says &quot;In actual fact&quot; a lot.  It seems to be a 'Britishism' with the American equivalent of &quot;believe it or not&quot; (Please correct me if I'm wrong!)  I don't mean to make fun of Dame Maggie here.  This is an attempt at a comedic video from a loyal fan. :){% endraw %}
