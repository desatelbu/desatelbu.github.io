{% raw %}My Club Marvy adventure started with a phone call from Ece Tonbul during which she invited me over to Kesre Bay for a dinner. It was an unforgettable evening at the phenomenal restaurant, Buono Italiano Christina Bowerman, who happens to be the only female chef in Rome with a Michelin star. I was sold right there and then when I tasted the dynomite parmesan pasta. <br />Our main goal at Marvy is to create a full experience which we named as a 3600 adventure. We have numerous events through the month of May. Like Ederlezi, a splendidly authentic Turkish ritual where roses and wishes play the main part. Following that, a group exhibition inspired by Can Yücel’s poetry will take place in the Atelier Marvy, art lovers will not want to miss this Yeşilmişik event. Then comes a star of our own, Şemsa Denizsel who will be offering a magnificient experience where we will hop on buses to visit the artichoke fields, after which she will delight us with her scrumptious recipes. As the flowers bloom around us, we will have our “Full moon of blossoms”, an extraordinarily alluring experience under the stars.<br />My objective is to add a few more wonderful acts to these lovely events, like celebrations in the magnificent environment of Marvy. Warm and unpretentious wedding ceremonies, birthday parties, anniversaries and such, with our signature sophistication and joyful surprises. <br />I would like to welcome you to Club Marvy for a healthy, safe and fun experience.<br />See you soon.<br />Have a good summer <br /><br />Discover our destinations at: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.clubmarvy.com/tr/beach-club-resort-turkey/anasayfa">https://www.clubmarvy.com/tr/beach-club-resort-turkey/anasayfa</a> <br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/clubmarvy/">https://www.instagram.com/clubmarvy/</a> <br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/clubmarvy/">https://www.facebook.com/clubmarvy/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/ClubMarvy">https://twitter.com/ClubMarvy</a><br />Linkedln: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/club-marvy/?originalSubdomain=tr">https://www.linkedin.com/company/club-marvy/?originalSubdomain=tr</a><br />Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2V7z21AtE2IJbKBwtP7JZ7">https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2V7z21AtE2IJbKBwtP7JZ7</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />MB01KUP7WLMBHGM{% endraw %}
