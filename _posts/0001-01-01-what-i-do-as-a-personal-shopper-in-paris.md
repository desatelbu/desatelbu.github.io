{% raw %}Bonjour tout le monde! This video is all about what I do as a personal shopper in Paris, breaking it down for you and at the end we go into a few stores that were open before quarantine. So let's go! I hope you enjoy watching :) OPEN ME FOR MORE INFORMATION <br /><br />I am a professional Fashion Stylist and Consultant and Personal Shopper here in Paris. I thought it might be useful to make a video talking about what I do since I get questions about it. So I thought I would describe to you exactly what goes on during one of my personal shopping sessions. I am so lucky to do what I love and what lights me up. I mean, shopping for a living? And meeting such cool people from around the World while I'm at it? It's a dream job. So if you're either here to just learn what a Personal Shopper does or are interested in booking a session with me (info below of how you can) then I hope you'll like this video and find it useful.<br />Be sure to like and let me know if you want more of this kind of video in the comments. Thank you so much for watching! :) <br />Merci d'avoir regard√©.<br /><br />//WHY DID I CREATE THIS CHANNEL?<br /><br />Paris is such a wonderful city and I love being here. However I am facing challenges as an expat like learning French, getting to know new people and having my own social circle here. Along with all the backend official things. On top of all that and most importantly I'm a mum of two young children. I have tons to juggle and learn and tons to share along the way.
