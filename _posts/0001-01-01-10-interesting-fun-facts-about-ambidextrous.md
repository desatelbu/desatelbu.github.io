No, with this we don't mean that you're really rich or that you belong to a group of unlawful bikers. You're just part of a very specific group of people. MENTAL FLOSS reports it like this: &quot;Even among a small population of 'muti-handed' individuals, very few experience equal ease and skill with both hands. In comparison, around 10% of people are lefties.&quot;<br /><br />2) Different Types. Believe it or not, the term ambidextrous doesn't apply to one group of people. In fact, the rarest of ambidexterity is when you can use either hand for any skill at any time (for example, you can write, pass a football or finger paint with either hand).<br /><br />3) Symmetry. The people that are right handed often show left brain dominance. Can you guess what kind of brains left handed people and the ambidextrous have? Well according to the people at MENTAL FLOSS: &quot;the hemispheres of ambidextrous and left-handed people's brains are almost symmetric...&quot;<br /><br />4) Synesthetes. Let's talk about synesthetes for a moment. These are people who... experience reality a little differently. The folks at MOTHER NATURE NETWORK describe Synesthesia (the condition synesthetes experience) like this: &quot;a perceptual condition in which the stimulation of one sense triggers an automatic, involuntary experience in another sense.&quot; <br /><br />5) LRRTM1 Gene. Life seems pretty good for people who are ambidextrous. They get to have brain symmetry, they get to see colors in numbers and weeks, they get to be a small percentage of bikers that are unlawful (wait, scratch that last one).<br /><br />For more information, please watch the video until the very end.<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Subscribe to Bestie : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/tUqro6">https://goo.gl/tUqro6</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Our Social Media:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/bestieinc/">https://www.facebook.com/bestieinc/</a><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Medical Disclaimer: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pastebin.com/xLmigD6i">https://pastebin.com/xLmigD6i</a>{% endraw %}
