{% raw %}This paper tackles the challenge of predicting<br />grasp failures in soft hands before they happen, by combining<br />deep learning with a sensing strategy based on distributed<br />Inertial Measurement Units. We propose two neural architectures, which we implemented and tested with an articulated soft<br />hand - the Pisa/IIT SoftHand - and a continuously deformable<br />soft hand - the RBO Hand. The first architecture (Classifier)<br />implements a-posteriori detection of the failure event, serving<br />as a test-bench to assess the possibility of extracting failure<br />information from the discussed input signals. This network<br />reaches up to 100% of accuracy within our experimental<br />validation. Motivated by these results, we introduce a second<br />architecture (Predictor), which is the main contribution of the<br />paper. This network works on-line and takes as input a multidimensional continuum stream of raw signals coming from<br />the Inertial Measurement Units. The network is trained to<br />predict the occurrence in the near future of a failure event.<br />The Predictor detects 100% of failures with both hands, with<br />the detection happening on average 1.96 seconds before the<br />actual failing occurs{% endraw %}
