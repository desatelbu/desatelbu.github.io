{% raw %}We love dividend paying investments but hate waiting.  Our Monthly dividends  that come mostly from ETFs are starting to be enough to pay some of our expenses, however we do choose to reinvest them. I share my monthly dividend stocks and how we invest and exactly how much we have invested to make this much money every month. I do not invest in the highest paying dividend stocks. I chose diversified investments like exchanged traded funds (ETFs). <br /><br />Motivated Money by Peter Thornhill: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2R1YJcz">https://amzn.to/2R1YJcz</a>  <br /><br />In this video I chat about compound interest and dividends being like a money printing machine and how it is achievable to eventually get a 7% return or higher from dividends. I share my first dividends payments and our dividend growth overtime. I explain why dividend investing works for us and how this helps with our strategy of debt recycling. I explain the tax on dividends and why it's not a concern for me. <br /><br />I then share our investments that give us a monthly dividend income. Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) make a large part of the dividend payments. I share how much we have invested to get to having this much in dividends. I also calculate the current yield and what our yield is as well. <br /><br />Finally, I share how I track dividends on our excel spreadsheet that is available in my Etsy store. It allows you to see what your projected dividend income will be, and the expenses that you have covered by dividends.<br /><br />Welcome to Family Finance where I chat all things personal finance and in particular family finances, how to save money, investing, budgeting and how to stay on track with your financial goals. Our goal is to build our passive income to reach financial independence, also know as FI. <br /><br />Other videos you might enjoy ...<br />OCT NET WORTH: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUC9Loh573c">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUC9Loh573c</a><br />DEBT RECYCLING: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGW-Tuq9NXU&amp;t=9s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGW-Tuq9NXU&amp;t=9s</a><br />OUR STOCK PORTFOLIO: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osUeiwhHBKM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osUeiwhHBKM</a><br />OUR 40% SAVINGS RATE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOmxtup9P0I&amp;t=3s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOmxtup9P0I&amp;t=3s</a><br /><br />Find me on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Family-Finance-103181858073913/">https://www.facebook.com/Family-Finance-103181858073913/</a><br />Find me on Instagram:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/familyfinance_/">https://www.instagram.com/familyfinance_/</a><br /><br />MY ETSY SHOP: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.etsy.com/au/shop/FamilyFinance">https://www.etsy.com/au/shop/FamilyFinance</a><br /><br />AFFILIATE LINKS<br /><br />4 Months Free with SHARESIGHT: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.sharesight.com/familyfinance">https://www.sharesight.com/familyfinance</a> <br /><br />Shop Back: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://app.shopback.com/nkVqgskJ49">https://app.shopback.com/nkVqgskJ49</a><br />Cash Rewards: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://refer.cashrewards.com.au/x/VzrCNY">https://refer.cashrewards.com.au/x/VzrCNY</a><br /><br />BOOKS TO READ<br />Motivated Money: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2R1YJcz">https://amzn.to/2R1YJcz</a>  <br />Die with Zero: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3CfizpY">https://amzn.to/3CfizpY</a><br />The Simple Path to Wealth: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/327vpYz">https://amzn.to/327vpYz</a> <br />Your Money or Your Life:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3jZm3o3">https://amzn.to/3jZm3o3</a><br />The Index Card: Why Personal Finance Doesn't Have to Be Complicated:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3tzcsdl">https://amzn.to/3tzcsdl</a><br />I Will Teach You To be Rich: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/35gvv2g">https://amzn.to/35gvv2g</a> <br />The Barefoot Investor: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/336AKP5">https://amzn.to/336AKP5</a> <br />Money Made Simple by Noel Whittaker: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/327Elxa">https://amzn.to/327Elxa</a> <br />Atomic Habits: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/32cCh7j">https://amzn.to/32cCh7j</a><br />The 5am Club: Own Your Morning, Elevate Your Life: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3h7PZwc">https://amzn.to/3h7PZwc</a> <br /><br />HOW I MAKE MY VIDEOS<br />I use Keynote to make my slides using images and text for from Canva:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.canva.com/join/rake-gardens-nails">https://www.canva.com/join/rake-gardens-nails</a><br />I then record my audio using my blue yeti microphone: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2ZfJv8A">https://amzn.to/2ZfJv8A</a> <br />I then use iMovie to link my audio with the Keynote slides. <br /><br />Please note: some of these links are affiliate links where I'll earn a small commission if you make a purchase at no additional cost to you.<br /><br />Disclaimer:<br />The information on this YouTube channel and the links provided are for entertainment and general information only and should not be taken as constituting professional advice.
