{% raw %}Overlook steps forthrightly into the cinematic horror of ‘Ultra Violence’, leading with an unnerving tonal soundscape which finally relents to aggressive industrial beats, climaxing in an assault across all frequencies. Joined by Karim Maas on ‘Heart of Darkness’ the pair explore the outer limits of distorted breaks and almost psychedelic screams from inside the machine. A clear evolution in the UVB-76 sound.<br /><br />Release Date: 26th March 2021.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://uvb-76music.bandcamp.com/album/uvb76-018">https://uvb-76music.bandcamp.com/album/uvb76-018</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.unearthedsounds.co.uk/collections/uvb-76-music/products/overlook-karim-maas-ultra-violence-heart-of-darkness">https://www.unearthedsounds.co.uk/collections/uvb-76-music/products/overlook-karim-maas-ultra-violence-heart-of-darkness</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/uvb76music">https://soundcloud.com/uvb76music</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/overlookdnb">https://soundcloud.com/overlookdnb</a>{% endraw %}
