{% raw %}For the 2nd episode of the series, we went to Tsaghkashat (Armenian: Ծաղկաշատ) village in the Askeran Province of Artsakh. A marvelous place which is home to numerous historical and cultural monuments: St. Astvatsatsin Church (19th century), cemetery (18-19th century), spring (19th century), khachkars (13th century), a Fortress (early Middle Ages) and Tombs from 2-1 thousand BC, as well as some 35 monuments. Nicole Duman House-Museum is also located here. <br /><br />Listen to the people of the village tell what they’ve been through, sharing their thoughts, feelings, hopes, and dreams of peace. <br />____<br />My name is Mariam and I am a filmmaker from Artsakh. I and my colleague Tigran are making a no-commentary-style documentary series to show post-war life in Artsakh called #TheDesireToLive. These short series are going to show the effects of the war on the regular people of Artsakh and their livelihood. If you want to learn more about Artsakh and the people that live in it, subscribe to the channel!<br /><br />I will release more episodes as we go, we’re filming every week and are a 2-person team.<br /><br />You can also support me by subscribing to my YouTube Channel, turning on the notifications, liking, commenting &amp; sharing the video help a lot as well!{% endraw %}
