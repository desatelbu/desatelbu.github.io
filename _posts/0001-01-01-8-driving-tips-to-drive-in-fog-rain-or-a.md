{% raw %}A car isn't just a way to from A to B. It's a serious responsibility and a potentially dangerous machine for you and others, especially if you have to drive in bad weather. Luckily, there are special driving tips to avoid accidents when it's pouring rain, the road is covered in ice, or you're driving in thick fog. <br /><br />TIMESTAMPS: <br />Driving in fog 0:37<br />Driving on black ice 1:43<br />What to do if your car starts skidding 2:42<br />Driving in heavy rain 3:48<br />Driving in the rain at night 5:16<br />Driving in the snow 6:02<br />What to do if your car went into a snow drift 6:43<br />Driving in a dust storm 7:38<br /><br />#badweatherdriving #raindriving #fogdriving<br /><br />Music by Epidemic Sound  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/">https://www.epidemicsound.com/</a> <br /><br />SUMMARY: <br />- If you're driving in really thick fog, turn off the radio and keep your windows rolled down. This way, you'll be able to hear what's happening around you to partially make up for your limited visibility.<br />- Black ice is tricky given that, in most cases, you can't spot it until it's too late. When driving at night, your headlights can serve as a useful warning that there’s ice ahead since they’ll reflect off the road.   <br />- A lot of people who drive a stick have been taught that, along with letting off the gas, you should also change the gear to neutral. Professionals, however, recommend against this.<br />- If you notice deep water ahead, just turn around. Driving through a large pool is too risky. You might damage the electronics of your car, get stuck, or even get swept away if the water’s moving.<br />- Raindrops on your windshield act as lenses that refract light. As a result, they can temporarily blind you, especially if it’s pouring rain and your whole windshield is covered in water. Try to adjust your headlights so that the light doesn't shine up.<br />- If the visibility is extremely low, slow down and turn on your hazard lights. Avoid using your brights since they can reflect light and blind you.<br />- If you’ve accidentally driven over a snow mound on the side of the road, do not turn the steering wheel in the opposite direction. Keep the same direction as before and, while steadily accelerating, get back on the road.<br />- As soon as a dust storm hits, pull over and entirely off the road. Also, make sure all your head- and taillights are off. If you don't turn off the lights, other drivers may believe that's where the road leads. They'll follow you and crash into your car. Do not resume driving until it's safe to continue your trip. <br /><br />Subscribe to Bright Side : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/rQTJZz">https://goo.gl/rQTJZz</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Our Social Media:<br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/brightside/">https://www.facebook.com/brightside/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/">https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/</a><br /><br />5-Minute Crafts Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC">https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />For more videos and articles visit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.brightside.me/">http://www.brightside.me/</a>{% endraw %}
