Inside he finds Chucky (Brad Dourif), who at first is rather angry until he realizes that he has a new child he can possess.<br /><br />FILM DESCRIPTION:<br />Several years have passed since the events of the previous film, and yet again the makers of Good Guys dolls -- a line which included the homicidal Chucky -- decide to reinstate their product line. Unfortunately, some of the materials used are still imbued with the evil spirit of serial killer Charles Lee Ray (voice of Brad Dourif), whose soul once inhabited the Chucky doll... and who returns to action in a spanking new Good Guy body. Determined at first to finish the job he started by swapping bodies with young Andy (Justin Whalin) -- who is now a teenager in military school -- Chucky decides to change tactics, setting his sights on a much younger boy. When Andy becomes aware of the situation, he is compelled to put a stop to Chucky's Satanic antics once and for all. The signs of a creatively-depleted horror franchise are evident (they had already shown themselves in the previous installment), but there is still enough juice left for the spooky climax, which borrows a riff from Tobe Hooper's The Funhouse.<br /><br />CREDITS:<br />TM &amp; Â© Universal (1991)<br />Cast: Jeremy Sylvers, Brad Dourif<br />Director: Jack Bender<br />Producers: Robert Latham Brown, David Kirschner, Laura Moskowitz<br />Screenwriter: Don Mancini<br /><br />WHO ARE WE?<br />The MOVIECLIPS channel is the largest collection of licensed movie clips on the web.
