{% raw %}​​​<br />​​​Butch and I have fun learning this new game.  It is easy to learn and play and offers a unique &quot;Gobble&quot; on a classic game.<br /><br />Find Here ▶ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Gobblet-Gobblers-Blue-Orange">http://bit.ly/Gobblet-Gobblers-Blue-Orange</a><br /><br /><br />Lucky Penny Thoughts: This game is based off of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe.  The twist is you can &quot;gobble&quot; up your pieces or your opponents pieces to change the color in a row or to win the game!  It is fun to play and this game will stay in the family collection.<br /><br />Later!<br />LPS-Dave<br /><br /><br />▶▶ Product Info <br />Gobblet Gobblers - Blue Orange, 5+, 2 Players<br /><br /><br />▶▶ Watch More Videos <br />Games, Vintage &amp; New: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MH8fg9dnKzg&amp;index=1&amp;list=PL27_x9U5H26vuQCxN_t7EWASxQIlw7Kgc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MH8fg9dnKzg&amp;index=1&amp;list=PL27_x9U5H26vuQCxN_t7EWASxQIlw7Kgc</a><br /><br />Butch The Dog - Lucky Penny #2: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZnraTez34A&amp;list=PL27_x9U5H26s0g_VGGL0dE9_Cqoh_FEUE&amp;index=1">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZnraTez34A&amp;list=PL27_x9U5H26s0g_VGGL0dE9_Cqoh_FEUE&amp;index=1</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Royalty Free Music by <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://audiomicro.com/royalty-free-music">http://audiomicro.com/royalty-free-music</a><br />Sound Effects by <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://audiomicro.com/sound-effects">http://audiomicro.com/sound-effects</a><br /><br />This video is not intended as an endorsement of the product shown.
