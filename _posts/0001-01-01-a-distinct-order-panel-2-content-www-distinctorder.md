{% raw %}www.distinctorder.britishcouncil.org/<br /><br />A DISTINCT ORDER curated by Roopesh Sitharan is part of OLD WORLD ORDER / NEW WORLD ORDERS, a programme from WE ARE HERE: Artists’ Moving Image developed by Tendai John Mutambu, British Council and LUX.<br /><br />This curatorial project presents a dialogue between UK and Malaysia in articulating the challenges of reimagining the eminence of plurality in ‘Order’. The central idea of Order addresses the necessity for predictability, or control over reality. While effort of such governance is most obvious through the routine lives of subjects regulated by certain authority, such reality also presents a brutally objective world in which anything, or anyone found at direct odds with what is accepted being circumscribed.<br /><br />Panel 2: Content is a panel discussion that invites artists, especially practitioners that deal with moving images, to discuss the possibilities offered by the medium in representing or highlighting issues of Orders through film. The discussion particularly centres on techniques of making, presenting and articulating facilitated by the medium as a form of expressing an idea, or critique.{% endraw %}
