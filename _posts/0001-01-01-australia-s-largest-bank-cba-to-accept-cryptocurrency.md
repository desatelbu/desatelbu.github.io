{% raw %}Australia's largest bank - the Commonwealth bank of Australia (CBA) - has announced that it will accept Cryptocurrency from 2022, with initial rollouts to start &quot;soon&quot;. They appear to be focusing on 10 cryptos, likely being the main candidates (i.e., BTC, ETH, etc). I discuss the implications that has for Commonwealth Bank and for cryptocurrencies more generally. And, in short, it is positive news. But, CBA's share price had a luke warm response, increasingly only slightly and underperforming ANZ. It is important to not read too much into this when looking at crypto markets more generally. <br /><br />Check out Swyftx for a reasonably low cost - and solid - exchange based out of Australia: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3nRl6BI">https://bit.ly/3nRl6BI</a> <br /><br />Binance is also good for low costs, but seems to have technical issues periodically. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2ZRS7FG">https://bit.ly/2ZRS7FG</a> #CBA #Crypto #Bitcoin<br /><br /><br />Books<br />* My regression book: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3v22Asg">https://amzn.to/3v22Asg</a><br />* My valuation book: [US]: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2LUwYQW">https://amzn.to/2LUwYQW</a> [Australia] <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2WWX6Ra">https://amzn.to/2WWX6Ra</a><br /><br />Courses: <br />* Portfolio Management: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bullbearfinance.teachable.com/p/portfolio-management">https://bullbearfinance.teachable.com/p/portfolio-management</a><br />* International Finance: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://financialanalysis.teachable.com/p/international-finance">https://financialanalysis.teachable.com/p/international-finance</a><br />* Valuation: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://sydneyfinanceacademy.learnworlds.com/course/investment-valuation-fundamentals">https://sydneyfinanceacademy.learnworlds.com/course/investment-valuation-fundamentals</a><br />* Options, Futures, and Derivatives: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://financialanalysis.teachable.com/p/options-futures-derivatives">https://financialanalysis.teachable.com/p/options-futures-derivatives</a><br /><br />My Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/bullbearfinance">https://www.patreon.com/bullbearfinance</a><br /><br />****************************<br />*MY GEAR<br />****************************<br />Razer Seiren Mini: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Sbmtz2">https://amzn.to/2Sbmtz2</a><br />Logitech c922: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2xDUfTs">https://amzn.to/2xDUfTs</a><br />Softlight setup available here from Amazon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2xHVEbF">https://amzn.to/2xHVEbF</a><br />Wacom writing tablet: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2YHmyeK">https://amzn.to/2YHmyeK</a>{% endraw %}
