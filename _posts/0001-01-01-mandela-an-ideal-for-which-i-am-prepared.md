{% raw %}The last 5 minutes of Nelson Mandela's speech at his trial, 20th April 1964 in which he uttered the memorable line &quot;It is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.&quot; <br /><br />I made this for my public speaking students—a couple of lines are missing from the original recording. My first attempt of doing something like this—still getting used to the software.{% endraw %}
