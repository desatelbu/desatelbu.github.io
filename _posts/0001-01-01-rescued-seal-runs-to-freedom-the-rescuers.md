{% raw %}The rescuers from Ocean Conservation Namibia &quot;hide&quot; in the bright early morning sun to get as close to a group of seals as possible. They have spotted a nearly invisible entanglement and cannot believe their luck when Antoine catches the animal with the rescue net. They open the side zipper, cut the loop of commercial fishing into half to remove it off the seal's neck, and a few seconds later they get to watch this beautiful animal run towards freedom. This moment is the rescuers' reward for the often dangerous and hard work. <br /><br />To find out more about our work, please like, comment, share and subscribe to our videos and visit: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ocnamibia.org/">https://www.ocnamibia.org/</a>  <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gogetfunding.com/Seal/">https://gogetfunding.com/Seal/</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/OCN">https://www.patreon.com/OCN</a> <br />Merchandise now available at: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/ocean-conservation-namibia">https://teespring.com/stores/ocean-conservation-namibia</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/NamibiaOcean">https://twitter.com/NamibiaOcean</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/oceanconservationnamibia/">https://www.instagram.com/oceanconservationnamibia/</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/OCNamibia">https://www.facebook.com/OCNamibia</a>{% endraw %}
