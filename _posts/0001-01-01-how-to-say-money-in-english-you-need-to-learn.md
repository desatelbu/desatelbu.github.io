{% raw %}In this English lesson, you will learn how to say money in English. Many English learners don't know how to say money (e.g., $1.35). In this lesson I teach you how to say dollars and cents. And I show you Canadian coins too! Also, you'll learn how to have a simple conversation for shopping. When you go to checkout, you need to know what to say to the cashier. I'll teach you the English vocabulary and culture you need to go shopping, buy what you need, and get the right amount of change! <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/madenglishtv/">https://www.facebook.com/madenglishtv/</a>{% endraw %}
