{% raw %}From the album &quot;There's No Leaving Now&quot;, out on June 12, 2012.<br /><br />Lyrics:<br />We have clear blue waking skies<br />and the morning after<br />and memories of gold on the run<br />flying around<br />was there a drunken cloud<br />over someone just empty<br />a vision of a mountain you said<br />so where did it go<br />It was light and I held it like a child to be saved<br />from the fires, from the falling down satellites<br />but still wondering<br />Damn, you always treat me like a stranger, mountain<br />though you've seen the shadow between the city and what is mine<br />and fallen kids, all rising mad among their lost believers<br />suddenly darker in their eyes and their broken smiles<br />It's only what these kids will haul around<br />There's a lot of selling land for hungry feet of answers<br />and medicine for balance and things, like seeing your ghosts<br />thank god we're bright, said the lantern's brother,<br />because I don't know a thing about boats, or the land I see...<br />It was day and i stood there once again, climbing equipped<br />when I knew you were the one throwing dying stars<br />on our gathering<br />but he said, damn, you always treat me like a mountain, stranger<br />though I have never seen your shadows or fading lights<br />I'm just a rock that you'll be picking up through all your ages<br />always believing there's a canyon for every blind<br />it's only what these kids will haul around.{% endraw %}
