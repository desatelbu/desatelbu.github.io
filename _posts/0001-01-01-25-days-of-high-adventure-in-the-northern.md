Ted Baird and I are questing for Hudson Bay on a 700km, off-grid wild camping adventure using many wilderness techniques along the way. This day finishes off with us paddling into heavy winds and a bushwhack to find a campsite. There, we fillet walleye that we‚Äôd caught with survival fishing tackle at an amazing fishing hole earlier that day. We rig up a tarp as thunder rolls in and begin over the fire cooking fish for dinner. This is a true wilderness adventure. <br /><br />The next morning, we awake to rain and it‚Äôs pouring as we break camp. Bushwhacking back to the canoes we look way out onto the lake to see large whitecaps. We go for it and endure several hours of white-knuckle paddling into large waves and a strong headwind to cross the lake. Back in the shelter of the river where the wind‚Äôs blocked, we make some distance, only to be thwarted at large, Chipewyan Lake where the winds are gusting and the waves are huge. It‚Äôs raining out and we‚Äôre cold. We‚Äôre wind bound so we bushwhack in from shore to find a tent spot a rig a tight camp in the rain. I use my folding saw and Hudson Bay axe to fell a standing dead tree and split it. Then, I get the fire going in the rain by using trash for tinder. Soon we‚Äôre enjoying hot chocolate and warming up. Dehydrated food is for dinner. We go to sleep with our fingers crossed, hoping the weather will break so we can travel come morning. <br /><br />Thanks a lot for watching, please like this video üëç hit the bell icon to revive a notification when I upload a new vid üîî and of course, subscribe!
