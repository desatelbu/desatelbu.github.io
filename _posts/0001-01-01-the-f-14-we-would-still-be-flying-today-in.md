{% raw %}In the early 1990’s, Grumman proposed a new iteration of the famed Top Gun fighter that was not only modern enough to still be in service today, it would have marked a vast improvement in performance and capability over even Maverick’s highly capable F-14D.<br /><br />While the F-14D took on the title “Super Tomcat,” this effort to modernize the F-14 began under the moniker “ST21,” which, appropriately enough, stood for “Super Tomcat for the 21st Century,” and make no mistake — that’s exactly what it could have been. <br /><br />📱 Follow Sandboxx on social<br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/sandboxxnews">https://twitter.com/sandboxxnews</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/sandboxxnews">https://instagram.com/sandboxxnews</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/sandboxxnews">https://facebook.com/sandboxxnews</a><br /><br />📱Follow Alex Hollings on social<br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/AlexHollings52">https://twitter.com/AlexHollings52</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/AlexHollingsWrites">https://www.facebook.com/AlexHollingsWrites</a>{% endraw %}
