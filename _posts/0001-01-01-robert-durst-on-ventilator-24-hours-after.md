{% raw %}Convicted murderer Robert Durst began fighting for his life just one day after being sentenced to life in prison for the killing of his friend Susan Berman. Durst has been put on a ventilator as he battles COVID-19, for which he tested positive on Friday, just 24 hours after his sentence was handed down. In court, the real estate mogul, who has bladder cancer, was clearly unwell. Slumped in a wheelchair, Durst could be seen at times gasping for breath.{% endraw %}
