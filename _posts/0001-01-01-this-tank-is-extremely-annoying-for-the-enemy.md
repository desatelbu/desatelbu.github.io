{% raw %}The Wiesel 1a4 in War Thunder is SO sneaky.  This little 20mm buggy is extremely fast and manoeuvrable.  Although it only has 66mm of penetration its speed can get it in and out of trouble whenever it likes.<br /><br />The Wiesel was introduced with Ground Breaking and this version might not be as potent as the Wiesel 1A2 TOW but it's sure as heck fun to play!!!<br /><br />In this video I take the Wiesel to higher tiers so I can maximise the amount of fun I had!<br /><br />I can highly recommend this little thing to be a complete troll on the battlefield! :)<br /><br />Decal:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://store.gaijin.net/catalog.php?category=WarThunder&amp;partner=Oddbawz&amp;partner_val=2bpa5qx4">https://store.gaijin.net/catalog.php?category=WarThunder&amp;partner=Oddbawz&amp;partner_val=2bpa5qx4</a><br />Merch:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://oddbawz-shop.creator-spring.com/">https://oddbawz-shop.creator-spring.com/</a><br />Discord:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/oddbawz">https://discord.gg/oddbawz</a><br />Instagram:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/oddbawz/">https://www.instagram.com/oddbawz/</a><br />Twitter:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/OddBawZ">https://twitter.com/OddBawZ</a><br />Business Email:  oddbaw01@gmail.com<br />Patreon:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/join/oddbawz">https://www.patreon.com/join/oddbawz</a><br /><br />NUKE INTRO (00:00)<br />THE SNEAKY NINJA (02:02)<br />GAME 1 - DESERT STORM (04:22)<br />GAME 2 - ALMOST A NUKE (07:55)<br />GAME 3 - EVEN AT LONG RANGE IT'S FUN (16:01)<br />OUTRO (24:14){% endraw %}
