{% raw %}This Yin Sequence will elongate your connective tissues in your side body, and stretch all areas around your spine. it will create space in places you likely didnâ€™t even realize were constricted. <br /><br />We focus a lot of our time on forward folds and backbends in our yoga practice and our every day life, but it is crucial for our bodies health that we donâ€™t neglect the side body! The poses we flow through today will help stretch the ribcage and allow for deeper breath throughout the day after you practice. The openness you create in this sequence will create the physical space you need to be intentional with your breath on and off the mat. <br /><br />Yin is a slow and meditative style of yoga where you hold the poses for longer. The focus is on surrendering in to the pose, sitting with all the sensations that arrive and ultimately experiencing a deep letting go and a sense of calm. I hope you find time this week to nourish your body, deeply rest and restore with this yin yoga sequence for your side body.<br /><br />For this class you might want to grab a bolster, some pillows or a folded blanket. <br /><br />Enjoy this class ðŸ’›<br /><br /><br />âŸ¡ SOCIAL MEDIA âŸ¡<br />Instagram @the.bare.female<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/the.bare.female/">https://www.instagram.com/the.bare.female/</a><br /><br />âŸ¡ VISIT MY WEBSITE âŸ¡<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thebarefemale.com/">https://thebarefemale.com/</a><br /><br />* The Yoga Studio in which this class was filmed is available for booking.
