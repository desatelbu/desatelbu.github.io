{% raw %}No joke--my own dad actually forgot my birthday.  Besides this, I decided I wanted my birthday to be memorable this year, so we shared our gender reveal with our family that day.  We had family from Utah, Texas, Northern CA come so they could be there on this day.  Of course it was still my birthday, so we made one of my favorite meals (Mexican food), we opened presents, went bowling, played some games, and had delicious homemade cake!

Family Fun Pack is my family of 8 who love to travel and live life to the fullest. With new videos of our daily adventures and milestones posted regularly, you are sure be entertained on our channel.  I offer parenting advice each Monday in my Mommy Monday vlog. I also share my parenting style along the way in my other vlogs, but I like to do it in a more subtle way that comes across as I vlog my daily life.  Our videos are authentic family fun. Thanks for following my journey though parenthood as a mom!<br /><br />Want to send fan mail?

We made this video simply for entertainment.<br />#familyfunpack #genderreveal #happybirthday{% endraw %}
