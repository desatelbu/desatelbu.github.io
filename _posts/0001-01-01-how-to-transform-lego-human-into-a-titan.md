{% raw %}Hello everyone! Have you watched &quot;Attack on Titan&quot;? This is a real masterpiece of anime! And today we will make a craft based on this animated movie.<br /><br />Guys, you might remember we made the Lego Minion last year <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/nZ5J0TDZNYY.">https://youtu.be/nZ5J0TDZNYY.</a> Let's make some adjustments! The wooden Lego human is ready to transform into a titan! So how do we do this? <br /><br />We take our Lego human and cover it with foil to make a clay cast. First, we make a clay hat and then start to shape tendons on the Titan's face. When the head is finished we’ll send it into the oven for 30 minutes at 130 degrees Celsius. <br /><br />While the head is being baked, we'll move to other parts! It's time to create an eight-pack! The Colossal Titan is very buff! We shaped his chest muscles and now let's add more structure. Don't rush here, a steady hand is very important at this stage. Then let's bake the body in the oven for 30 minutes at 130 degrees Celsius.<br /><br />The next stage is the platform. To make it, use a round wooden shape and cover it with putty and add some details. We will place a wall, houses, and trees. It seems very small compared to the main character, so the Colossal Titan looks very powerful! <br /><br />And the final stage is our favorite creative one! We need to make the Titan brighter, so we'll paint it using black and brick red. And of course, we will add accents using bright red.<br /><br />This Titan looks amazing! Check it out too!
