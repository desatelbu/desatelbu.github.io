{% raw %}Shop Mural Pens here ✷ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://muralpens.com">https://muralpens.com</a> ✷ Here is the newest release of Mural Pens! With new colours and sizes. Mural Pens are my own brand of paint pens, made with a special acrylic paint blend, designed to have the perfect flow on walls, wood, canvas, (and more!).<br /><br />I created Mural Pens about 5 years ago as I couldn't find the best paint pen, so I started the journey to design premium paint pens. Since their first release, Mural Pens have sold out numerous times, have many repeat customers and glowing reviews!<br /><br />New to the Mural Pens range:<br />8mm Black, 5mm Gold, 1mm Black, 1mm Gold<br /><br />The 1mm pens have replaced the older 3mm pens for finer, more accurate line work. Adding the 8mm means that you now have 3 very different weights for black-paint artworks. Gold Mural Pens have been asked for many times, here they are finally!<br /><br />✷✷✷<br /><br />SHOP<br />Mural Pens ✷ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.muralpens.com">https://www.muralpens.com</a> <br /><br />✷✷✷<br /><br />Sign up for my online course!
