His infamous Reincarnation allows the Wraith King to rise again after death, acting like an Aegis of the Immortal, making him especially difficult to kill. But if left alive, the Wraith King can wreak havoc upon his enemies; his Wraithfire Blast provides reliable damage and a stun on a short cooldown, Vampiric Spirit grants himself sizeable lifesteal and passively helps make short work of foes, while its active allows for quick pushing. Mortal Strike is a guaranteed critical strike that triggers every few seconds and is Wraith King's primary form of high sustained damage, especially in the lategame, once he has enough farm and levels. A lumbering and straightforward hero, Wraith King can nonetheless become a terrifying lategame carry who is nigh-immortal if left unchecked.<br /><br />www.dotabuff.com/matches/6287240945<br /><br />Learn about Dota 2:<br />According to wikipedia.org, &quot;Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed and published by Valve. The game is a sequel to Defense of the Ancients (DotA), which was a community-created mod for Blizzard Entertainment's Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos and its expansion pack, The Frozen Throne. Dota 2 is played in matches between two teams of five players, with each team occupying and defending their own separate base on the map. Each of the ten players independently controls a powerful character, known as a &quot;hero&quot;, who all have unique abilities and differing styles of play. During a match, players collect experience points and items for their heroes to successfully defeat the opposing team's heroes in player versus player combat. A team wins by being the first to destroy the other team's &quot;Ancient&quot;, a large structure located within their base.&quot;{% endraw %}
