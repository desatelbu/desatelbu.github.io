The character sonic the hedgehog is a blue anthropomorphic hedgehog who can run at supersonic speeds and curl into a ball, primarily to attack enemies. In most games, sonic must race through levels, collecting power-up rings and avoiding obstacles and enemies. Most of the games are developed by Sonic Team. The original sonic the hedgehog game was released to provide Sega with a mascot to rival Nintendo's flagship character Mario. Sonic was redesigned by Yuji Uekawa for Sonic Adventure, with a more mature look designed to appeal to older players.
