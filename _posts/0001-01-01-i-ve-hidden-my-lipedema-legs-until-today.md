{% raw %}SUBSCRIBE to Truly: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj">http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj</a><br /><br />ELISE Sasso, a United States Virgin Islander, inherited a genetic disorder called lipo-lymphedema from her late mother. The condition, which is a combination of Lipedema and Lymphedema, causes an excess of fat to accumulate in different parts of the body. Growing up, Elise didn’t realise she had the condition as her mother was never diagnosed. She was often told to simply diet and exercise to lose weight. “It made me feel self-conscious,&quot; she told Truly. “I didn’t want to show off my legs.&quot; When she realised her condition was chronic, Elise created a not for profit organisation called Beauty is the Beast to raise awareness about the condition. She said: “I want to be the individual who breaks down the barriers that society has put up.&quot; Elise now feels confident to show off her legs in public so she is going to her friend Lisa’s shop to try on some clothes that reveal her legs. “It’s fun, it’s confidence, it’s freedom,&quot; she said. <br /><br />Follow Elise here:<br />Website - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://beautyisthebeastinc.com/">https://beautyisthebeastinc.com/</a><br />Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/countess_rose/">https://www.instagram.com/countess_rose/</a><br /><br />Videographer: Michael Catron<br />Producers: Milly Martin, Ruby Coote<br />Editor: Paul Zeller<br /><br />Truly is on TikTok! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show">https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show</a><br /><br />Now you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES">http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES</a><br /><br />Click here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! <br />Truly - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow">https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow</a><br />Born Different - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/">https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/</a><br />Shake My Beauty - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/">https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/</a><br />Hooked On The Look - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/">https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/</a><br />Love Don't Judge - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/">https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/</a><br />Beastly - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/">https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/</a><br />Ridiculous Rides - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/">https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/</a><br />Dog Dynasty - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/">https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/</a><br /><br />For more amazing content, click here!<br />Beastly: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA</a><br />Barcroft Cars: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured">https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured</a>{% endraw %}
