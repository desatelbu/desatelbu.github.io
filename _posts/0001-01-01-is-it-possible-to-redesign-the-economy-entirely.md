{% raw %}When Chris Grantham realised that the economy is in fact designed, rather than a naturally occurring phenomena, he realised that it then of course be redesigned. What happened next was a journey that led him to become the lead of IDEO's circular economy work portfolio. What does it mean to be living in a context where what we're designing has shifted from products, to companies, to economic systems?  <br /><br />The 2018 Summit took place at The Roundhouse in London on Thursday June 21st. Speakers discussed big ideas and world-views re-shaping how we view our economy, the role of digital technologies in making the previously unimaginable possible and shared stories of disruptive realities in business, cities and policy already happening today.<br /><br />------<br /><br />Thank you for watching this video.
