{% raw %}Idler editor Tom Hodgkinson chats to musician and writer Baxter Dury about his new memoir Chaise Longue. <br /><br />The poet laureate of London’s Ladbroke Grove, Baxter Dury has spent the last 15 years uniquely chronicling the inner workings of his (and everyone’s) human condition over six critically acclaimed albums. His latest, The Night Chancers, was released in March 2020. His memoir, Chaise Longue, is out now.<br /><br />In this chat, Baxter discusses growing up in the chaos of 1970s and 80s bohemian West London. He talks sensitively about his artist mother and 'disruptive' father Ian Dury, as well as his babysitter the Sulphate Strangler, one of an entourage of characters who feature in his memoir, available here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://uk.bookshop.org/books/chaise-longue/9781472155139">https://uk.bookshop.org/books/chaise-longue/9781472155139</a><br /><br />This conversation was recorded as part of the Idler's weekly online event, A Drink with the Idler.
