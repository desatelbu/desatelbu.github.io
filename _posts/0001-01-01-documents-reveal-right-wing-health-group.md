{% raw %}The conservative group called &quot;America's Frontline Doctors&quot; has been revealed to be working with healthcare companies to sow doubt about the COVID vaccine while pushing bogus &quot;treatments&quot; that the group has a financial stake in. This includes both hydroxychloriquine and ivermectin. The damage that this group has caused is immense, and they are laughing all the way to the bank as their misinformation campaign has netted them millions of dollars. Ring of Fire's Farron Cousins explains what's happening. <br /><br />Link - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.alternet.org/2021/09/ivermectin-and-hydroxychloroquine/">https://www.alternet.org/2021/09/ivermectin-and-hydroxychloroquine/</a><br /><br />Become a member today!: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYWIEbibRcZav6xMLo9qWWw/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYWIEbibRcZav6xMLo9qWWw/join</a><br /><br />Support us by becoming a monthly patron on Patreon, and help keep progressive media alive!: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/TheRingofFire">https://www.patreon.com/TheRingofFire</a><br /><br />Find our merchandise at Teespring: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/rof-store">https://teespring.com/stores/rof-store</a><br /><br />Spread the word!

So when we see all these individuals that have been out there pushing things like ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID, even though they are not COVID treatments and they really have no effect on it, we have to question why they're doing that. But now actually we don't have to question why they're doing that because a hacker has revealed documents that show that they're doing this because they're making a ton of money off it, millions and millions of dollars pushing these bogus COVID cures that aren't cures at all. Here's the thing, the group America's frontline doctors that rose to prominence last year after Donald Trump retweeted a video of one of them allegedly claiming that we had the cure for COVID, which was hydroxychloroquine. Even though, again, it does not treat COVID as an anti-malarial drug that has shown promise, by the way, with rheumatoid arthritis, but not COVID. So, anyway, here's what the documents revealed.<br /><br />America's frontline doctors is a right wing group founded last year to promote pro-Trump doctors during the coronavirus pandemic, is working in tandem with a small network of healthcare companies to sow distrust in the COVID-19 vaccine, dupe tens of thousands of people into seeking ineffective treatments for the disease, and then sell consultations and millions of dollars worth of those medications. The data indicate patients spent at least $15 million and potentially much more on consultations and medications combined. So what you do is you contact America's frontline doctors, and yes, these are people that are real medical doctors. And, you do, I guess it would be an online consultation and through this online consultation, which you pay $60 for, they then prescribe you, you know, these quack cures, the hydroxychloroquine, the ivermectin, you know, anti-parasitic and anti-malarial drugs. So people go and fill these prescriptions. Oh, but no, it turns out these same doctors, according to these documents, may have financial ties to the companies putting out these drugs. There's always an ulterior motive, folks.<br /><br />You always have to follow the money. And for the record, this is not just with America's frontline doctors. We talked about this recently an upcoming anti-vax event, you know, where Eric Trump is going to speak. Actually, I think it already happened. But the people the anti-vaxxers putting on that convention have made millions of dollars selling alternative medicine as treatment for cancer. You also had other people there who've written, you know, books attacking the American healthcare system, talking about anti-vax stuff. And, you know, they go out there, they speak to the crowds, they sell more books. There's a financial motive for these individuals is what I'm getting at here. So if you're one of the people that's vaccine hesitant, if you're an ivermectin pusher, if you're a hydroxychloroquine pusher, please understand the people pulling the strings here have been revealed to be frauds. They're not doing it because they believe it's better treatment. They're doing it because it's putting more money in their personal bank accounts. They're not trying to protect you. They're trying to push their financial interests.{% endraw %}
