This tournament features Mizkif, Ludwig, Boxbox, Papaplatte, Emiru, Jawsh, and more. Also, the Emiru Simply chip thief drama continues. My Doritos were stolen. I also stole your time because you are reading about Mizkif mario content thing but also some Emiru mario. Emiru mario speedruns are so cool and awesome. Simply's Super Mario 64 world record speedrun was also cool to watch. You can catch these mario 64 speedruns live on Twitch. Goodnight!{% endraw %}
