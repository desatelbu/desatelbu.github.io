{% raw %}Ever since I backflipped a motocross in a foampit, I've always wanted to try it on a jetski. And lucky for us, the european champion in freestyle jetski is a Belgian called Niels Willems. My guy has been a champion for a couple of years now and agreed to teach us how to backflip his jetski in freezing cold water in less than 2 hours. If this all sounds like a bad idea, it's because it's actually a bad idea.
