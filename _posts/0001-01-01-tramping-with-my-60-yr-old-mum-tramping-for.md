{% raw %}Since mid-way through this year, we've been getting Mum ready for her upcoming Summer season of hiking on the New Zealand Great Walks! We're currently booked on the Tongariro Northern Circuit in early December, and the Heaphy Track in late January.<br /><br /><br />As a complete beginner hiker and tramper, relatively new to overnight hiking let alone multi-day trips, it's been important to make sure Mum gets as comfortable as possible with spending multiple nights on the trails.<br /><br /><br />I'm always looking for relatively easy overnight tracks for us to attempt, so Mum can tackle a variety of different tracks and trails in different environments. But finding tracks during the winter months is often a problem!<br /><br /><br />So back in June, before I started my new career, we took a last-minute trip to the Coromandel to hike to Pinnacles Hut on the Kauaeranga Kauri Trail. Unfortunately, the weather didn't play ball for our planned loop circuit via the Webb Creek and then Billygoat Tracks, but we were still able to have a fantastic experience nonetheless.<br /><br /><br />Watch the video to see the full adventure!<br /><br />⬇ Watch Next<br />○ PLAYLIST - Te Araroa North 19/20:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3eeOpbU">https://bit.ly/3eeOpbU</a><br /><br />------------------------------------------<br />------------------------------------------<br />**BECOME A PATRON FOR MORE EXCLUSIVE CONTENT**<br />As a subscriber of my channel you'll automatically get weekly updates from my upcoming thru-hike of Te Araroa's South Island right here on this channel.
