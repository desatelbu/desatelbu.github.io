{% raw %}Only rain down the drain 🌦️👍<br /><br />Our Streamclean team joined Bristol Avon Rivers Trust and other volunteers to take part in the Yellow Fish Project to raise awareness of misconnections and river pollution.<br /><br />Many people are unaware that there are different drainage systems and that anything poured or connected to the wrong drain can end up polluting the local environment.{% endraw %}
