{% raw %}This market trading analysis applies to various exchanges, including Bitmex and Binance. Tackling questions like if Bitcoin can reach all time highs again and if we will be seeing a crypto currency market recovery this year. Things like the lightning network have provided huge improvements for BTC and while it is true that others like Roger Ver with Bitcoin Cash (bcash) may disagree, I do see these blockchain technology innovations to be very bullish fundamental signs for the space. <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://t.me/forfliesgold">https://t.me/forfliesgold</a><br />To join VIP, click on my name (@Forflies) at the bottom of Telegram posts and message me.
