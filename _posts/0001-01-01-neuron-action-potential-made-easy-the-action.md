{% raw %}The action potential is the mechanism by which nerve cells communicate and conduct information. This short lecture covers topics such as generation of neuronal action potential (nerve impulse), neuronal polarization, depolarization, repolarization, hyperpolarization, resting membrane potential, threshold potential, and refractory period.<br /><br />Thanks for watching and don't forget to SUBSCRIBE, hit the LIKE buttonüëç and click the BELL buttonüîî for future notifications!!! <br /><br />Like what we do?
