{% raw %}Hi Guys &amp; Girls<br />A while back some disturbing photos where shared on social media about dead sharks left on the beaches of Flasebay. Eagle rays, smooth hounds and Barbel... this is no way to treat a fish! Please fish responsible and respect the ocean and all fish, put them back where they belong. <br />I hope this video helps someone on how to handle them!<br /><br />Today we were targeting Kob, and it was a one man show.. but i'll let you watch for yourself..<br /><br />If you learned something of liked the video PLEASE SUBSCRIBE while you there, Thanks!<br /><br />#KOB #EAGLERAYS #BLUERAYS{% endraw %}
