Nope. The year of collapse this time around? Exactly the same year again<br /><br />So while it’s hard for historians to identify what caused the collapse of previous Civilizations, collapses usually fall under 4 categories, which are: Political, Social, Climate &amp; Economic<br /> <br />So how did MIT predict the end of the world then? <br />The MIT team created World 3, which was a computer model for assessing if the current usage of the world's resources was sustainable<br /><br />We know that the larger a population becomes, the more food, water, houses, and other resources it needs, but our planet has finite resources. We also live in a society of crony capitalism, where companies deliberately create ‘built-in obsolescence’ into their products so that they break and we buy more<br /><br />All adding to the landfill and the increased speed of our natural resources running out<br /><br />Declining birth rates lead to an ageing population putting more financial pressure on workers through taxes to fund pension schemes and care<br /><br />Last month I covered and explained how our current pension systems are scheduled to collapse by 2032 according to Western Governments own data &amp; reports<br /><br />This financial pressure will mean younger workers will work more, leading to further declining birth rates<br /><br />While the study accounted for hundreds of variables in the global economy, it was only actually interested in tracking five of them. These were, population, food, resources, industrial output and pollution<br /><br />As you would assume from a range of different models, they got different results, but they all had one thing in common. They all  showed a collapse of society around the year 2040<br /><br />This year, more researchers have reviewed the study adding an additional 5 metrics for even greater accuracy thanks to the advent of AI. And I don't have good news for you… <br /><br />They narrowed down all the previous results to the two most likely scenarios, best case &amp; worst case<br /><br />The best case scenario was called - (CT) Comprehensive Technology:<br /> <br />This was a model based on continuing to live as we currently do, but technology progresses fast enough to ensure our productive capacity is able to keep up with all of the new people<br /> <br />Again, the population plateaus around the year 2040, but that’s due to wealthier more urban populations having less children, rather than people starving to death due to a lack of food. In this model, industrial output still peaks and then declines like the other models due to a lack of resources <br /> <br />The worst-case scenario model is called - Business as Usual 2 or (BAU2):<br /><br />This is a model that highlights a very clear collapse of civilization as we know it. Pollution continues to increase, and a drop in available food causes birth rates to plummet in rich &amp; poor countries alike. And when I say plummet, I really do mean plummet.
