{% raw %}New York Attorney General Leticia James has subpoenaed Donald Trump to testify in a civil fraud case exploring the allegation that fraud &quot;permeates&quot; the Trump Organization, as reported in the Washington Post. <br /><br />Given that the Trump Organization and its Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg are under indictment for a 15-year-long criminal scheme to defraud, Donald Trump plainly has a Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination which he could invoke at the deposition. <br /><br />There are significant differences and consequences involved when one pleads the Fifth in a criminal case versus a civil case. This video discusses the difference and what's at stake for Tump now the he has been subpoenaed to testify. <br /><br />For our Team Justice and Justice Matters merchandise shop, please visit: <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shop.spreadshirt.com/glennkirschner/">https://shop.spreadshirt.com/glennkirschner/</a><br /><br />Please consider becoming a #TeamJustice patron at:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/glennkirschner">https://www.patreon.com/glennkirschner</a><br /><br />My podcast, &quot;Justice Matters with Glenn Kirschner&quot; can be downloaded where you get your podcasts.
