This is actually a toxic compound that can cause hallucinations in large amounts. <br /><br />This is why some people should avoid wormwood, including:<br />• Women who are pregnant<br />• Women who are breastfeeding<br />• Those who suffer from epilepsy<br />• Children <br /><br />Always check with your doctor before taking wormwood or any other dietary supplement. <br /><br />If your doctor approves of wormwood, make sure you only take it for four weeks at a time. Long-term use may cause health complications. <br /><br />Wormwood can be used for:<br />• Parasites<br />• Irritable bowel syndrome and Crohn’s disease<br />• Inflamed kidneys<br />• Digestion<br /> • Increase stomach acidity<br /> • Increase bile<br /> • Reduce bloating<br /> • Reduce gas<br /><br />If you try wormwood extract, let me know how it works for you in the comments below. <br /><br />Dr. Eric Berg DC Bio:<br />Dr. Berg, age 56, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis &amp; Intermittent Fasting.
