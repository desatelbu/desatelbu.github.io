{% raw %}The now 11-year-old son of Ronnie Oneal III told the Tampa Bay area jury what he remembers from the evening of March 18, 2018. It's the night Oneal, of Riverview, is accused of gunning down the boy's mother with a 12-gage shotgun and, according to testimony, even trying to recruit his son to help. If convicted in the double murder trial, Oneal faces the death penalty. Oneal is representing himself without a defense attorney. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2S557UM">https://bit.ly/2S557UM</a><br /><br />NEW TO OUR CHANNEL? <br /><br />Hi!
