{% raw %}There are several versions of the attacked Israeli fighter. The most widely circulated are two â€“ the Israeli Air Force has discovered positions of Iranian air defense systems in Syria and destroyed them. The second version is that the fighters withdrew from the operation after they found out that they had been intercepted by Iranian air defenses.<br /><br />Both versions are confirmed by Aviapro and Haaretz. Israeli media claim that in recent years, in addition to deploying surface-to-air missile systems on Syrian territory and supporting the Syrian Arab Army, Tehran has deployed dozens of drones, attacking or reconnaissance, also on Syrian territory to participate.{% endraw %}
