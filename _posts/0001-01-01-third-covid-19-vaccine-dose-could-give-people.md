{% raw %}Booster vaccines could give people two to three years' protection from COVID-19, according to Professor Luke O'Neill.<br /><br />He says third shots are leading to a &quot;huge&quot; immune response and give people very strong protection against serious illness.<br /><br />Ireland's booster campaign has been getting underway, with healthcare workers, over-60s and vulnerable groups set to get a third dose of a vaccine over the coming weeks and months.<br /><br />Other countries such as Israel have already started population-wide booster campaigns.<br /><br />Professor O'Neill -Professor of Biochemistry at Trinity College - told The Pat Kenny Show we're now getting lots of data about how well the extra doses are working.<br /><br />He said: “This is a huge study from Israel - 1.15 million people. A huge number of people were followed after the booster shot.<br /><br />“There was huge protection after the third shot - 93% protection against severe disease, and 92% against hospitalisation.<br /><br />“The unboosted ones, who they had as a kind of control group... they had a higher risk of hospitalisation.<br /><br />“What’s happening is the booster is restoring protection back to what it is.”<br /><br />Professor O'Neill said the immune response is so strong it could give people two to three years' protection.<br /><br />He also believes three shots will become the norm for anyone receiving a COVID-19 vaccine for the first time.<br /><br />He observed: “After Christmas, I predict, anybody getting a vaccine from the start will be given three shots - this will become a three-shot vaccine, and that will constitute full vaccination.<br /><br />“It's working so well... you’d be foolish not to give the third shot, given it’s causing a huge response.”{% endraw %}
