{% raw %}It's not a secret that Ikea gets a lot of its organic traffic exclusively from its brand keyword. HOWEVER what they have done to rank #1 for keywords like &quot;couch&quot; and &quot;mirror&quot; is incredible, and it's what we cover in the video today. <br /><br />IKEA puts a huge focus on their category pages since that's where most of their traffic comes in from. But once they've ranked for that incredible keyword that's where the challenge begins. <br /><br />How in the world do you know what someone wants when they search the keyword &quot;couch&quot;? <br /><br />- Is this person looking for the best way to buy a couch? <br />- Do they even know which type of couch they want? <br />- Do they merely want to browse and look at prices? <br /><br />The actual user intent behind generic keywords like &quot;couch&quot; is very hard to know which is why we need to build category pages thinking about all possible types of intent - and IKEA does that to perfection. <br /><br />Timestamps: <br />0:00 Intro <br />0:20 IKEA Traffic Stats<br />0:43 Top Pages<br />1:34 Keywords <br />2:08 The main problem <br />3:04 Category Pages<br />4:39 Internal Linking<br />5:50 Rooms Category <br />6:48 Recap<br /><br />‚ù§Ô∏è My Favorite SEO tool:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://surferseo.com/?fpr=jaume74">https://surferseo.com/?fpr=jaume74</a><br /><br />üë®‚Äçüíª Connect with me<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaume-ros-salvador/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaume-ros-salvador/</a><br /><br />üåé Follow me on Twitter<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/jaumeros6">https://twitter.com/jaumeros6</a>{% endraw %}
