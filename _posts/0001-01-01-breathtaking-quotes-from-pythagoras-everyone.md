{% raw %}I always have great respect for people who have excelled in the exact sciences. Pythagoras, as one of the founders of the exact sciences, is one of the most respected figures in me. His quotes about life, the universe and numbers will take the imagination far beyond the human mind. Many Words of Pythagoras sound like Revelations from another world and not everyone is given to understand them.{% endraw %}
