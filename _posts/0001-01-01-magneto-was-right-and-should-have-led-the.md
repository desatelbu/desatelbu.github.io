{% raw %}The X-Men cinematic universe spans 13 films, and Magneto appears in all but 3 of them--that's even more movies than Wolverine. And he's not always an antagonist--many of the films show Magneto working with Xavier and the X-men to save the mutant race. The reason Magneto became such a staple in the X-universe is because, deep down-we all know that he was right.<br /><br />Mutants will always be threatened by humanity, and he wanted to protect his people. Actually, his dire warnings about humans are proved true by the events of Days of the Future Past and Logan. In both films, humans have eradicated mutants through different means. This video walks us through the philosophy of Erik Lensher, his history, and shows why he's the leader the X-Men needed. <br /><br />If you're new, Subscribe! → <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/subscribe-screencrush">http://bit.ly/subscribe-screencrush</a><br /><br />Go here → <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://screencrush.com/">http://screencrush.com/</a><br />Like us → <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/ScreenCrush">https://www.facebook.com/ScreenCrush</a><br />Follow us → <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/screencrushnews">https://twitter.com/screencrushnews</a><br />Get our newsletter → <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://screencrush.com/newsletter/">http://screencrush.com/newsletter/</a><br /><br />Written and Edited by Pavel Terehovsky (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pavel8866.wixsite.com/pavelt)">https://pavel8866.wixsite.com/pavelt)</a> pavel8866@gmail.com<br />Hosted by Ryan Arey (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/ryanarey)">http://twitter.com/ryanarey)</a>{% endraw %}
