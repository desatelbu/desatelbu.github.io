{% raw %}Welcome to Divinely Canadian Tarot. My name is Jaime and of course I am Canadian. <br /><br />&quot;Our bodies are just temporary vessels for our souls, which will go on forever. You really are an extension of the power that created the whole universe, no matter what drags you have on.”<br />— RuPaul<br /><br />I currently DO NOT do personal readings. My readings are general, love, career, hobbies and interests. I will provide the theme for all my readings.  <br /><br />LEGAL DISCLAIMER** Not 100% accurate. You're all responsible for your OWN life/outcomes. I'm not qualified in any way shape or form to base your life decisions on my readings in ANY way. My readings are for entertainment purposes only. I am excited to be the channel to your readings. Remember several energies are present with all readings when reading for individual signs. Personal readings can provide a much clearer reading that you may find more intuitive. I may give personal readings in the future. <br /><br />If you do not resonate with my readings for your Sun sign, check out your other sign videos on my channel such as your Moon or Rising signs. I use the Nebula APP. Your Sun sign rules your personality, it is your soul. Your Moon sign rules your emotional core it is your heart. Your Rising sign rules your outer appearance, it is your book cover.<br /><br />I will be providing extended readings for all signs soon as well as 18+ readings wink wink, more details to follow once I get enough subcribers ❤<br /><br />#Tarot #Readings #DivinelyCanadianTarot{% endraw %}
