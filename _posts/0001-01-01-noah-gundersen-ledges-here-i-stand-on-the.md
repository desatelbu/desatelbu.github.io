{% raw %}Here I stand on the edge of the ledges, that Noah Gundersen have made...<br /><br /><br /><br />Lyrics:<br />I got a lot of loose ends<br />I've done some damage<br />I've cut the rope so it frayed<br />And I've got a lot of good friends<br />Keeping me distracted<br />Keeping my sanity safe<br /><br />Here I stand on the edge of the ledges I've made<br />Looking for a steady hand<br />Here I stand in a land full of rocks in the valleys<br />Tryna be a better man for you<br /><br />But I drink a little too much<br />It makes me nervous<br />I've got my grandfather's blood<br />And I take a little too much<br />Without giving back<br />If blessed are the meek then I'm cursed<br /><br />Here I stand on the edge of the ledges I've made<br />Looking for a steady hand<br />Here I stand in a land full of rocks in the valleys<br />Tryna be a better man for you<br /><br />I wanna learn how to love<br />Not just the feeling<br />There are the consequences<br />I wanna learn how to love<br />And give it all back<br />Forgive me all that I've done<br /><br />Here I stand on the edge of the ledges I've made<br />Looking for a steady hand<br />Here I stand in a land full of rocks in the valleys<br />Tryna be a better man<br /><br />Oh, here I stand on the edge of the ledges I've made<br />Looking for a steady hand<br />Oh, here I stand in a land full of rocks in the valleys<br />Tryna be a better man for you<br /><br /><br /><br />Music:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://noahgundersenmusic.com/">http://noahgundersenmusic.com/</a>{% endraw %}
