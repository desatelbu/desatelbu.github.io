{% raw %}One winter morning started, my food was very little, I started my journey into the forest far to find food, I packed a packet of rice, brought water, I went everywhere in the forest, looking for food. wild fruit, and the food in the forest, I went down to a deep pit, I saw a dead wild boar down there, I saw a lot of scratches on the boar's body maybe it was slipped and fell from above, it was still new and not decomposed, I started a fire and butchered the meat{% endraw %}
