{% raw %}Paul used to have a job as a window cleaner when his life took a turn for the worse. Paul started to drink, which led to sofa surfing and eventually homelessness sleeping rough on the streets of London. <br /><br />In the UK, homeless shelters are often referred to as hostels. Paul has been in and out of hostels for a few years. Paul says rough sleeping wasn't so bad, but things have started to change. The streets and living homeless are not what they once were. <br /><br />Paul says he didn't stay in the hostels because many of them are outside of London. Even here in the United States, homeless shelters are located in areas where neighbors will allow over where they need to be to provide support for rough sleepers. <br /><br />Paul survives by panhandling. If he can make enough money, Paul hides his sleeping bag to pay to go into a single room occupancy for the night. <br /><br />This interview is a few years old. I like Paul, and I hope he was able to get off the streets into housing. Sadly, the UK's affordable housing crisis may even be worse than it is here, and because of the pandemic, rough sleeping continues to grow. <br /><br />More stories from London: <br /><br />Natasha is 22 years-old and has been homeless sleeping rough in London for 4 years <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/6TLVgwoqhoc">https://youtu.be/6TLVgwoqhoc</a> <br /><br />Giving Socks to Homeless People Sleeping Rough in London and Cardiff <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/SiDBU91Mo44">https://youtu.be/SiDBU91Mo44</a><br /><br />Homeless Youth Sleeping Rough in London after Mother Died <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/24To8SF46jU">https://youtu.be/24To8SF46jU</a> <br /><br />#london #homeless #roughsleeper <br />==================================<br /><br />Subscribe here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/invisiblepeople?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/c/invisiblepeople?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />Invisible People’s website:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://invisiblepeople.tv">http://invisiblepeople.tv</a><br /><br />Support Invisible People:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://invisiblepeople.tv/donate">https://invisiblepeople.tv/donate</a><br /><br />On Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/invisiblepeople">https://www.patreon.com/invisiblepeople</a><br /><br />Invisible People’s Social Media: <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/invisiblepeople">https://www.youtube.com/invisiblepeople</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/invisiblepeople">https://twitter.com/invisiblepeople</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/invisiblepeople">https://www.instagram.com/invisiblepeople</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/invisiblepeopletv">https://www.facebook.com/invisiblepeopletv</a><br /><br />Mark Horvath’s Twitter: <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/hardlynormal">https://twitter.com/hardlynormal</a><br /><br />About Invisible People<br /><br />There is a direct correlation between what the general public perceives about homelessness and how it affects policy change. Most people blame homelessness on the person experiencing it instead of the increasing shortage of affordable housing, lack of employment, childhood trauma, lack of a living wage, or the countless reasons that put a person at risk. This lack of understanding creates a dangerous cycle of misperception that leads to the inability to effectively address the root causes of homelessness.<br /><br />We imagine a world where everyone has a place to call home. Each day, we work to fight homelessness by giving it a face while educating individuals about the systemic issues that contribute to its existence. Through storytelling, education, news, and activism, we are changing the narrative on homelessness.<br /><br />This isn’t just talk. Each year, our groundbreaking educational content reaches more than a billion people across the globe. Our real and unfiltered stories of homelessness shatter stereotypes, demand attention and deliver a call-to-action that is being answered by governments, major brands, nonprofit organizations, and everyday citizens just like you. <br /><br />However, there is more work to be done on the road ahead. Homelessness is undoubtedly one of our biggest societal issues today and will only continue to grow if we don’t take action now.<br /><br />Invisible People is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit dedicated to educating the public about homelessness through innovative storytelling, news, and advocacy. Since our launch in 2008, Invisible People has become a pioneer and trusted resource for inspiring action and raising awareness in support of advocacy, policy change and thoughtful dialogue around poverty in North America and the United Kingdom.{% endraw %}
