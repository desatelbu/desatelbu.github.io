The game was released on November 19, 2021[a], for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X and Series S. Unlike recent Battlefield games, Battlefield 2042 is solely multiplayer and does not have a single-player campaign. It also features support for cross-platform play, a first in the series. Similar to its predecessors, Battlefield 2042 is a multiplayer-focused first-person shooter. As the game is set in the near future, it features futuristic weapons and gadgets like deployable turrets and drones, as well as vehicles that players can commandeer. Players can now request a vehicle air-drop to any location. The game also introduces a new &quot;Plus&quot; system which allows players to customize their weapons on the spot. The class system was significantly overhauled. Players can assume control of a specialist who falls under the four traditional Battlefield gameplay classes of Assault, Engineer, Medic and Recon. These characters can wield all the weapons and gadgets players have unlocked. Each operator has their own unique skills and gadgets. For instance, one of the specialists, Emma &quot;Sundance&quot; Rosier, is equipped with a wingsuit, while another, Maria Falck, is equipped with a healing pistol. Levolution and destructive environments from Battlefield 4 return in Battlefield 2042, and extreme weather effects such as tornadoes and sandstorms will affect gameplay. The game will feature seven maps at launch. In this video DreamcastGuy does an honest review of Battlefield 2042 while showing the glitches, guns, and gameplay and why this is a huge downgrade from the series even on PS5. This is done in an angry rant style format, similuar to some of the heated conversations had on the SpawnCast on the SpawnWave channel.  The game has three main gameplay modes. &quot;All-Out Warfare&quot; encompasses &quot;Breakthrough&quot; and &quot;Conquest&quot;, two staple modes of the series. In Conquest, two teams combat against each other to capture control points; once control points in a sector are captured, the team will control said sector. In Breakthrough, one team must try to capture another team's control points, while another team must defend them. Both modes can be played with and against artificial intelligence. The PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X and Series S versions support 128 players, whereas the PS4 and Xbox One versions only support 64 players. For the first time in the series, Battlefield 2042 features support for cross-platform play with the PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S versions. While the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions also support the feature, it is restricted to only players on the two aforementioned platforms.{% endraw %}
