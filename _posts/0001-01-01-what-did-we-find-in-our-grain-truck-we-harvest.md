On this YouTube channel, we plan to show viewers what happens on a real life family farm in Kansas. From working with animals, to planting seeds, to harvesting grain, to putting up hay, to fixing equipment, you'll get to see what farming is like! Our farm is a 5th generation farm started in 1882 by our great great grandparents. We grow wheat, corn, soybeans, milo, sunflowers, and forages and we feed about 1,000 head of cattle. To learn more about it, watch our channel intro video here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vGk5e3_LB8&amp;t=29s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vGk5e3_LB8&amp;t=29s</a>{% endraw %}
