Whether it is at work or at home, mastering crucial conversations is an essential life skill that all of us can get better at. <br /><br />------------------------------------------<br />‚òùÔ∏è Smash that LIKE button... if you are going to crush the next crucial conversation üëçüëç<br />------------------------------------------<br /><br />Crucial conversations are those high stake conversations that we have all had in our lives. Whether that was an unexpected chat with your boss, a break up with partner or having to give a friend or a neighbor some negative feedback, they are an unavoidable part of life. The stakes a high, the emotions are high and the opinions vary - a recipe for disaster... unless you have the right tools to handle them.<br /><br />This is where &quot;Crucial Conversations - Tools For Talking When Stakes Are High&quot; by Paterson, Grenny, McMillan and Switzler comes into play. With the help of this video summary, in just a few minutes, you'll be able to understand how to master those life changing conversations in your own personal and professional life. Not to mention, the video is completely FREE, while you'll have to spend a few bucks to get your own copy of the Crucial Conversations book ;)<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Check out these awesome FULL courses (no charge) right here on YouTube:<br /><br />1) How To Eliminate Your Stress (FULL COURSE) - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCZOcsNyk-g4W4Kc_MaZsWFFFAztrFpU2">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCZOcsNyk-g4W4Kc_MaZsWFFFAztrFpU2</a><br /><br />2) How To Stop Procrastinating (FULL COURSE) - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCZOcsNyk-g7itGkhU7SYkzgp6n7poZCH">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCZOcsNyk-g7itGkhU7SYkzgp6n7poZCH</a><br /><br />Or some of the viewer favorites playlists:<br /><br />3) How To Wake Up (Early &amp; Happy) - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCZOcsNyk-g6zePS8yQgoHBewE3nkFTh3">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCZOcsNyk-g6zePS8yQgoHBewE3nkFTh3</a><br /><br />4) Most popular videos - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCZOcsNyk-g4Y0OVCUTB6RxETX6IWolO9">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCZOcsNyk-g4Y0OVCUTB6RxETX6IWolO9</a><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />The best course of action is the following - watch this Crucial Conversations summary and learn about the best communication skills and tactics. Apply them in your life (or at work). If you are happy with the results (as you most likely will be), head over to Amazon or to your favorite bookstore and get yourself a copy of the actual book. This way you dig deeper into these teachings only once you have proven they can work for you. <br /><br />This Crucial Conversations summary gives you not only what the book is about, but how to actually apply it. Because, let's be honest, you can read the book, or listen to the Crucial Conversations audiobook... BUT unless you start applying what you've learned, nothing will change in your personal and professional life (isn't that always the case?!)<br /><br />Watch this animated summary, take action, apply the tactics to your life and you'll see dramatic results. I had the intention initially to do a Crucial Conversations summary PDF, but honestly, an animated video review is so much more fun to create, and consume.<br /><br />Mastering important conversations has never been easier - it only takes 10 minutes.<br /><br />As always, post your comments and questions below.
