{% raw %}Heavy rain will be likely, bringing with it maybe another inch or two of rain with locally heavy amounts before we can finally start to dry out Friday night. A few lingering showers will be possible Friday afternoon and evening. A storm  could become strong with gusty wind and hail as we heat up. Thankfully, our rainy pattern comes to an end by the weekend. While we could have a stray shower Saturday, for the most part we will be dry all the way through next Thursday.<br /><br /><br /><br />ubscribe to 13WMAZ for exclusive content: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRNf0_t4Qo5eojj8sSvd_8A">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRNf0_t4Qo5eojj8sSvd_8A</a>  <br /><br /><br /><br />13WMAZ News is the #1 station for news and weather in the Central Georgia area, serving people in Dublin, Macon, Milledgeville and Warner Robins.<br /><br /><br /><br />Follow 13WMAZ on Social: <br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/13WMAZ">https://www.facebook.com/13WMAZ</a><br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/13wmaz/">https://www.instagram.com/13wmaz/</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Visit Site: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.13wmaz.com">https://www.13wmaz.com</a>{% endraw %}
