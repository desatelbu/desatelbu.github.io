Heâ€™s the oracle of Omaha, the most famous and successful investor of all time, the man who built Berkshire Hathaway into one of the most valuable companies in the world, and in doing all that, he became one of the wealthiest people alive as well. In recent years though, heâ€™s come under a lot of fire from people who disagree with his investment philosophy, who donâ€™t like how he has performed over the last decade, and who claim that maybe, just maybe, heâ€™s lost his touch. Now I might not be one of those critics, but that doesnâ€™t mean I canâ€™t recognise the validity behind their arguments. Over the last year especially, Warren has been building an absolutely monstrous cash position, waiting for the buying opportunity that seemingly, doesnâ€™t want to arrive. Today, weâ€™re going to listen to what Buffett has to say, why heâ€™s been building this cash position, and maybe even what he expects for the future. <br /><br />DISCLAIMERS:<br />Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for &quot;fair use&quot; for purposes such as criticism, commenting, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
