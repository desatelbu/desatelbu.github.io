{% raw %}Ann Kenrick OBE, Master of the Charterhouse, takes you on some guided glimpses of the Charterhouse in lockdown. Here she walks along the striking exterior of our site, situated on the north side of Charterhouse Square. Elements of the exterior go back to the 14th century, complimented by the modern entrance opened in 2017.{% endraw %}
