{% raw %}One can never avoid or stay away from the things or the people that annoy them. Anger is a very complex emotion.  Some have described it as intense antagonism towards something or someone who you believe did you wrong. Though not easy, if uncontrolled, anger can be a problem. One can learn to control it. Many have found themselves in situations that if otherwise they had controlled their anger the end result would have been different. A good number are serving jail terms due to crimes they committed as a reaction to anger.<br />Remember to subscribe, like, share, comment and press the notification button.<br />Thank you for choosing this channel.{% endraw %}
