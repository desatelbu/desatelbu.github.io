{% raw %}Slater and I were shookt when we got a hold our our expenses ever since we had a baby. They tripled!!! We did expect to spend more, but not this much more. I guess it's also a lot to do with the variety of things on the market and not knowing what you really need. When you are a new parent, it's easy to get caught up in the excitement and buy so many random things for your baby. I was in that boat myself just a year ago. After we had Scottie though, I now know exactly which purchases were gold, and which were ultimately super useless and a waste of money. To save you guys from my predicament, I'm gonna talk about the essentials you need and when you have a newborn baby, and exactly how much it's gonna cost you. These are all items I have, use and abuse. Hopefully, this list will help you out too!<br /><br />Links:<br />1.
