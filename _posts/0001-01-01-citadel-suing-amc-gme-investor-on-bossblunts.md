Buy Calls on my therapist... $65 strike price...<br /><br />As of 8/1/21 we are entering a new debt ceiling crisis with congress on a 6 week vacation, combined with an expired rent moratorium where 6.2 million renters face evictions, the homeowners of said tenant's houses will likely never receive back-pay for rent owed possibly causing record high bankruptcies akin to 2008 or worse, and without taking this into account, CBO projects a federal budget deficit of $3.0 trillion this year as the economic disruption caused by the 2020â€“2021 coronavirus pandemic, while the legislation enacted in response continue to boost the deficit (which was large by historical standards even before the pandemic).<br /><br />In August 2011, during the debt ceiling crisis, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected that the federal budget would show a deficit of close to $1.5 trillion, or 9.8 percent of GDP.<br /><br />That is nearly 1 percentage point higher than the shortfall recorded in 2010 and almost equal to the deficit posted in 2009, which at 10.0 % of GDP was the highest in nearly 65 years at the time.<br /><br />At 13.4 % of gross domestic product (GDP), the deficit in 2021 would be the second largest since 1945, exceeded only by the 14.9 % shortfall recorded in 2020.<br /><br />For the period of economic expansion from the second quarter of 2009 through the fourth quarter of 2019, real GDP increased at an annual rate of 2.3 %.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/21999">https://www.cbo.gov/publication/21999</a><br /><br />The CBO estimates from 2011 would be heaven compared to the reality we're facing, which is a crippled economy and stock market on the verge of collapse. Evidence below;<br /><br />In 2011 CBO projected the 3 month Treasury bill to be worth 4.4% in 2021.<br /><br />The actual 3 month Treasury bill rate for July 2021 is worth between 0.01 and 0.06%.<br /><br />In 2011 the projected 10 year Treasury note bill rate was projected to be 5.4% for 2021<br /><br />The actual 10 year Treasury note bill rate is 1.24% In July 2021<br />...<br /><br />Report Released by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Beureau of Economic Analysis, on the Gross Domestic Product, Second Quarter 2021<br /><br />Personal Income: &quot;Current-dollar personal income decreased $1.32 trillion in the second quarter, or 22.0 percent, in contrast to an increase of $2.33 trillion (revised), or 56.8 percent, in the first quarter of 2021.&quot;<br /><br />Americans have lost $2+ TRILLION in savings, Q2 2021 ALONE....{% endraw %}
