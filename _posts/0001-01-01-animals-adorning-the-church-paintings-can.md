{% raw %}Can you spot the animals in the Church?  They are in the paintings!  Animals have been used as symbols for various religions and belief systems over human history. Numerous animals have been a part of the symbolism of the Catholic religion for hundreds of years and can be found in some of our 17th century paintings that adorn the Spanish Catholic Church at Mission San Luis. Look around the Church in this video to see if you can find these animals and learn what they represent.<br />________________________<br />From 10 am to 4:30 pm on November 7th, 2020, special pre-recorded Virtual Blessing of Animals videos will be posted in celebration of animals past and present!
