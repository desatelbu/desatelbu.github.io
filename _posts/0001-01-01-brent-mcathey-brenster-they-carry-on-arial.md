{% raw %}This original song I wrote was inspired by some amazing friends whom I've lost in the last five months. I'd like to dedicate it to all those who's loved ones  have passed on and are no longer with us, with the message that the memories we've made...<br />             &quot; They carry on &quot;<br />PLEASE SHARE to honor all those gone to soon.{% endraw %}
