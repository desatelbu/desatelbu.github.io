{% raw %}Donate: paypal.me/ChloeFund <br />I came home today and decided to listen to some music. When I came across Lacey Sturm's album again and heard a few songs, I was inspired to create this. In case you didn't understand what's going on in the video, it begins with Elsa talking to Pitch Black whom is representing Satan. It's about how evil is deceitful. It can appear as something good but inside it's dark. It's also about delieverance from all that is vanity and evil, turning toward God/Jesus Christ/Holy Spirit who is love instead of being confused with &quot;love&quot; that evil promises. I hope you enjoyed this video! God bless!<br /><br />Song: Vanity and Rot<br />Album: Life Screams<br />Artist: Lacey Sturm<br />Movies Used: Frozen and Rise of the Guardians<br />Characters: Elsa and Pitch Black<br />Editor: XxNekoWithWingsxX<br /><br />All content used in this video belongs to their respective owners.{% endraw %}
