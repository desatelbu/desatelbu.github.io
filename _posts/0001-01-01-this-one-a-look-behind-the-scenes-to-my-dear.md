{% raw %}To my dear friends,<br /><br />Creating my latest music video &quot;This One&quot; was a deeply personal experience and I wanted to share the thoughts and feelings I experienced as we produced the music video.<br /><br />I could not anticipate the enormous self growth and emotional development that emerged as I went through the various stages of production.<br /><br />In the beginning we were very focused on the technical process, and getting every detail right from the timing of the flights to the correct number of strings in the orchestra.<br /><br />This was an enormous project to undertake and required a ton of planning, and I was hyper-focused on every piece falling into place.<br /><br />But suddenly, it was showtime!<br /><br />I flew to Israel and then Macedonia for the filming and recordings of the project and honestly, I never dreamed that it would be such a beautiful, magical journey of self growth and introspection.<br /><br />Every beat and every nuance from this music video came straight from my heart.<br /><br />I really gave you all a piece of me.<br /><br />And with all of my heart, I hope you enjoy some of the story behind it and a glimpse of what it meant for me to create this music video.<br /><br />Love you all,<br />Bracha<br /><br />video creds:{% endraw %}
