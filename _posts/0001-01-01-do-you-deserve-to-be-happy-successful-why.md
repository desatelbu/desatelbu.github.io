{% raw %}Why being successful and happy is not a matter of deserving it, but taking action to make it happen.<br /><br /><br /><br />In this video coaching newsletter I discuss an email from a coaching client who has become a little jaded, fearful and uncertain of whether or not he deserves to be happy, loved and successful. He says that so many people around him have not had their lives turn out very good, and therefore why should he deserve to have it any better than they have it? <br /><br /><br /><br />“You don’t get what you deserve in life. You only get what you negotiate and work for tirelessly to make happen. Nobody is coming to save you or to make your dreams come true. You must do that yourself. Successful people think in terms of decades when it comes to making their grandest goals and dreams a reality. Unsuccessful people think in terms of instant gratification and if success doesn’t come right away, then it is hopeless and impossible, and they simply give up trying and settle for a life of simply existing and being mediocre. We all have the same 24 hours in a day. Successful people choose to be productive while unsuccessful people make excuses and distract themselves being busy majoring in minor things.” ~ Coach Corey Wayne<br /><br /><br />Click the link below to read the article “Do You Deserve To Be Happy &amp; Successful?” on my website:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://understandingrelationships.com/do-you-deserve-to-be-happy-successful/68497">https://understandingrelationships.com/do-you-deserve-to-be-happy-successful/68497</a><br /><br />If you have not read my book, “How To Be A 3% Man” yet, that would be a good starting place for you.
