{% raw %}The concluding video in APA's four-part Performance Path Basics video series. Performance paths allow builders to value-engineer energy efficiency by viewing the entire home as a system, getting more bang for the buck by trading out high-cost building assemblies for less expensive, energy-efficient assemblies and systems elsewhere in the building. This video explains how builders can use APA's Performance Path to Energy Code Compliance brochure to easily find cost-saving substitutions. <br /><br />Watch part one: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/eRLOVSfnkYg">https://youtu.be/eRLOVSfnkYg</a><br />Watch part two: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/8b595XBdvnc">https://youtu.be/8b595XBdvnc</a><br />Watch part three: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/em06Za1ck-s">https://youtu.be/em06Za1ck-s</a><br /><br />For more information, visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.apawood.org/energy-efficiency">https://www.apawood.org/energy-efficiency</a>{% endraw %}
