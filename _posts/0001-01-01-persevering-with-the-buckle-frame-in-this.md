{% raw %}In this video a child is using the buckle frame. This frame is designed to help children practice with the mechanics of a buckle without the added pressure of using it on the spot when needed. This type of buckle is most often found as a seat fastener in car seats and wagons. <br /><br />Here a child is using the buckle frame, and having some difficulty getting the buckle to snap together. First, I'd like to point out the playful and persistent way I worked to help this child overcome their frustration with this activity. Learning how to use a buckle is challenging and requires precision and concentration. <br /><br />Second, I'd like to point out how this child persevered in spite of the obstacles he encountered while working to fasten the buckles. In the end, the two of us worked on completing this dressing frame together, which helped make this child feel cared for and understood.<br /><br />Does your child ever struggle with getting dressed or undressed? I'd love to know how you are supporting their journey with a playful tone!{% endraw %}
