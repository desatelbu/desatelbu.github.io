{% raw %}Pauline Hanson’s chief-of-staff James Ashby says he had to &quot;take a different approach&quot; for the federal election coming up.<br /><br />Mr Ashby was the one responsible for the One Nation cartoon poking fun at politicians such as the Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce, Prime Minister Scott Morrison, Senator Matt Canavan, and many more. <br /><br />“We had to take a different approach this election, I’m sick and tired of that serious element to all elections,” Mr Ashby said. <br /><br />“It was just by chance I happened to be on YouTube, and I caught an episode that this Melbourne based company created ... and I mulled over it for a bit, and I thought to myself ‘we need to create some parody and some humour’. <br /><br />“And so those discussions didn’t take long before we were able to come up with a proposition to the One Nation Executive and that’s where it went.”{% endraw %}
