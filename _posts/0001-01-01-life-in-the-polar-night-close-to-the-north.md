{% raw %}All I can say is WOW! We saw it brewing in the sky all day, then we jumped in to our car to check out what was going on above Longyearbyen. It was nothing short of spectacular! I live on Svalbard, an island close to the North Pole and we are currently in our Polar Night, which means no daylight! It is the perfect time to hunt for the elusive northern lights ⭐️<br /><br />➣ SUBSCRIBE for new videos every week! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/c/CeciliaBlomdahl">https://youtube.com/c/CeciliaBlomdahl</a><br />➣ Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/sejsejlija">https://instagram.com/sejsejlija</a><br />➣ Tiktok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMeHEygbT/​​​">https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMeHEygbT/​​​</a><br />➣ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://patreon.com/ceciliablomdahl">https://patreon.com/ceciliablomdahl</a> - I want to thank every single one who has signed up to my patreon, the support means everything to me!<br /><br />Guyyysss!
