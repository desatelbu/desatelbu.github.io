{% raw %}This is the newer version of my mod. Only showcases 3 units but does start with the all new Proton Collider superweapon!<br />Also includes the Argonaught Sonic Artillery unit.<br />Although anyone who has a keen eye will spot the Charged Particle Beam and Purifying Flame upgrades.<br />It's not a long video but it does show off quite well 3 of the 4 epic units!{% endraw %}
