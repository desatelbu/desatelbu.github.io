{% raw %}Real talk guys. For the longest time, I never wanted to admit I was sad, out of fear that people would judge me or say that Iâ€™m being ungrateful. Kahit ako napapaisip, how can someone like me, who looks like they made their dream come true, still be depressed?<br /><br />I did this talk recently and it was challenging to sum up everything about my mental health in 15 minutes. Itâ€™s my most honest sharing yet, and I wanted to be sure that if i spoke about it, it was coming from a place of strength and confidence. Thereâ€™s no way Iâ€™m 100% okay now as itâ€™s always a work in progress and everyday you just find healthier ways to cope. <br /><br />After this, I would like to continue talking about mental health with you. Iâ€™ve started to equip myself with the right people around me to make sure that whatever I share is helpful. Thank you to MUO, LoveYourself &amp; all my close friends who knew and who saw. ðŸ’™ <br /><br />Maybe sharing this will make somebody feel like theyâ€™re not alone. YOU ARE NOT ALONE. ðŸ’™ðŸ’™ðŸ’™{% endraw %}
