In the episode, a broader analysis of the history of the post-1960s American comedy scene the rise of &quot;Comedy Blockbusters&quot; starring newly-minted superstars of the stand-up and sketch-comedy world places Sandler's unexpected &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; stardom and his breakout into features in the context of an ongoing evolution in the relationship between the audience and popular humor. This SPECIAL EXTENDED PREVIEW is edited from two segments focusing on these themes; in particular the question of why not every superstar of the 70s stand-up comedy and &quot;intellectual humor&quot; magazine booms found the Hollywood success some others did - and what later effect this would have on the subsequent wave of talent that Adam Sandler (and his films) came to be emblematic of.{% endraw %}
