{% raw %}#acrylicpouring #fluidart #bloomswipe #embellishing<br />Hi guys! Thank you so much for being here ðŸ¥°<br />Thank you so very much Margaret B. ðŸ˜€ ðŸ’œ<br /><br />Today I'm working on a 16'' (40cm) round canvas.<br />I did say I would add a photo of the pens I used for embellishing at the end, I'm sorry I forgot!<br />I used Krylon Rose Gold Leafing Pen, Amsterdam Acrylic Marker in Deep Gold and a Pale Lilac fine tip gel glitter pen out of a cheap set that  I bought from Kmart, Australia.<br /><br />My friend Jessica Winterstrom has inspired this scoop and drag bloomswipe. Jessica does some amazing work on Instagram and now has her own Youtube channel,here is the link please go and subscribe, you will love her work: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9twcP3nYJA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9twcP3nYJA</a><br /><br />Pillow/base: British Paints low sheen house paint in White, to which I added a splash of GAC800.<br />Colours:<br />#TLP (This Little Piggy) pigments in Sangria mixed with Liquitex Prizm Violet<br />#TLP Blue Eyes mixed with Decoart Extreme Sheen in Pearl<br />TLP pigments, swiping tools, silicone stir sticks and silicone pour mats can be purchased from <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fluid-art.co/">https://fluid-art.co/</a><br />Pearlex Duotone Violet Brass<br />(Pearlex pigments are made by Jacquard and can be purchased worldwide).<br />Papermill pigments in Rose Gold (Papermill pigments can be purchased from Riot Art in Australia).<br />Folkart Colorshift Black Flash<br />Pebeo Iridescent Green Blue<br />All colours and pigments are mixed with untinted house paint and Jo Sonja varnish. <br />Please see video #92 for how I mix my colours (both pigments and tubes).<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovlqWm_BOxw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovlqWm_BOxw</a><br /><br />CA/Cell Activator: Today I am using Atelier Interactive in Metallic Copper, this is only mixed with Australian Floetrol. I never measure ratios, I mix until it leaves a slight trace when drizzled from around an inch above the surface. <br /><br />My style has changed and evolved dramatically since I took the Sheleeart E-Course and I can't recommend it enough!  <br /><br />If you too would like to evolve your art and find your own style using knowledge gained from taking the course, head over to <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://sheleeart.com.au/">https://sheleeart.com.au/</a> and use my discount code of sheleeart15NDA to receive a 15% discount from the E-Course. <br />Add the code in the box where it says 'coupon code'<br /><br />Once joined you will get access to the private Sheleeart Facebook group where Shelee hosts regular live video classes, your learning will be unending! The course is currently in the process of being upgraded and thus there will be a price increase, so get in quick before then as you will also receive access to all the new classes.<br /><br />Please subscribe to my channel (it's free), also hit the thumbs up button (if you like it) and share the video with your friends. Please try and watch the entire video, I try and always keep my videos under 20 minutes. I have a tip jar, it's definitely not expected, but if you'd like to tip any small amount would be greatly appreciated and will go towards buying more paint supplies. Thanks in advance it's: paypal.me/Nikidfluidart<br /><br />My lazy susan is glass and 20'' which was purchased from Coles supermarket, they can also be sourced from variety/dollar stores. The heavier the spinner, the easier it will spin, I'd also suggest you get the largest one you can so you can easily use it for larger substrates too.<br /><br />My metal spatulas are artist pallet knives, they can be purchased from <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fluid-art.co/">https://fluid-art.co/</a> or independent art stores.<br /><br />Find me on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/nikid.art/">https://www.instagram.com/nikid.art/</a><br />Find me on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/NikiDFluidArt">https://www.facebook.com/NikiDFluidArt</a><br /><br />Thank you so much for watching, please like, share and please subscribe, it's free.<br />Remember to hit the notification bell so you know when I upload a new video ðŸ˜€<br />Take care, stay safe and I'll see you soon ðŸ¥°<br /><br />Music Credits: Epidemic Sounds<br /><br />Created by InShot:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://inshotapp.page.link/YTShare">https://inshotapp.page.link/YTShare</a>{% endraw %}
