{% raw %}In this video you will see a selection of aerial content that is created by Surreal Media with different kinds of drones, such as Mavic Mini, Inspire and Mavic 2 pro. I'm Tim Wienk and I successfully obtained my RPAL (dutch drone license) so I have more permissions to fly in the world. Besides that I obtained the UTC Aerial Photography training course for better understandings of quality. <br /><br />For more information or inquiries contact us on our website surrealmedia.nl.<br /><br />What is aerial photography and aerial cinematography?<br /><br />Taking photographs or cinematic videos of the ground from an elevated/direct-down position. Mounted high resolution cameras with more than 4K resolution may be triggered remotely or automatically. To create a Surreal cinematic perspective. <br /><br />Drone applications<br /><br />Aerial photography and cinematography has wide practical applications in our daily life, such as movie production, promotional video production, sport marketing or city marketing.<br />City Marketing - promotional videos for Cities<br />Urban buildings have unique local design characteristics as well as their own purposes and artistics characteristics. By overlooking a city through an aerial aerial view, viewers can appreciate the artistic charm of urban planning from an unusual and Surreal perspective. Top views from the sky can help the government and enterprises better reflect the size, strengths and connections of cities and represent their advantages.<br />      <br />Festival and events<br /><br />Without being restricted by ground traffic and featuring a wide view and fast response, aerial photography and cinematography is suitable for large-scale events. The rise of drones has led to significant reduction in the cost of aerial photography and cinematography compared to helicopters.
