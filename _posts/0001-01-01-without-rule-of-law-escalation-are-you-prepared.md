{% raw %}Without Rule Of Law Escalation &amp; Are You Prepared For It?<br />WROL or without rule of law is already the situation in our major cities. SHTF doesn't start with a bang and we are watching things degrade in real time.<br /><br />Without rule of law is already the state of most metropolitan areas. And as preppers, it is our duty to examine these events in order to expand our preparedness. We are witnessing the slow degradation of society as a whole. Much like fashion trends, things start in the big city and work their way down to the surrounding environments. Unfortunately for the preppers that are in the cities, they are already dealing with this new reality. For those of us who are further out, we are currently receiving the warning sign of what's to come. This scenario never improves. It will only become worse.<br /><br />For more information on SHTF prepping, please visit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.MagicPrepper.com">https://www.MagicPrepper.com</a><br /><br />If you want coffee that's marauder approved from an American company that is veteran owned and operated, check out Invader Coffee here and support the channel at the same time! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2UJHq5I">https://bit.ly/2UJHq5I</a><br /><br />If you need gear for SHTF or even just want to do some shopping and you'd like to support this channel at the same time, check out the Magic Prepper Amazon storefront here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/magicprepper">https://www.amazon.com/shop/magicprepper</a><br /><br />Do you have backup power for emergency situations?
