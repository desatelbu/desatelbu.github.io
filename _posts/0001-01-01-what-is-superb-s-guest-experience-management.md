Or it was… until we created the first all-in-one platform that gathers every tool you need to market and run your restaurant. <br /><br />Focused on building guest relationships, Guest Experience Management (GXM) helps restaurants worldwide use data to provide every customer with a personalised experience – turning guests into regulars. <br /><br />The world is changing, and a new era is emerging – The Data Era.
