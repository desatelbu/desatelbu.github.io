{% raw %}In this interview, Brian and Darryl Panes from As Good As Gold Australia look at gold and silver's surge over the last 6 weeks. Have both metals finally broken the shackles of the renowned manipulating forces?<br /><br />We are indeed living in a world gone mad with no attention being paid to economic fundamentals.<br />One senses there will be a huge price to pay for doing so - there always is.<br />The FED has its back to the wall and is out of bullets!<br />If they don't tackle inflation by raising interest rates, the bond market tanks.<br />If however, the FED tries to raise rates to save bonds, it kills the stock market and the property market. So where to from here?<br /><br />Inflation is everywhere!<br />Food, energy, transport, property and cars - it's everywhere! Or is it?<br />When these seemingly inflated prices are measured against gold, one draws a completely different conclusion - a startling and alarming comparison.<br /><br />Finally, with the ongoing saga of Evergrande.<br />No economy has ever been able to ignore a property bubble or even offset it and continue to grow, replacing the bust of the real estate sector with other parts of the economy.<br />Will China be any different?<br /><br />While government and central bank policies continue to support the destruction of FIAT currency, gold and silver remain your best form of protection against a rapidly failing economy.<br />Access it while you can. It's never been more important to do so.{% endraw %}
