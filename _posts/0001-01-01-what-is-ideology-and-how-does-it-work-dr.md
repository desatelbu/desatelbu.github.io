{% raw %}Dr. Matthew Hale, Assistant Professor of Communication, provides a very basic introduction to the concept of ideology. We examine a few things in this video. First we define ideology, taking a look at the work of Terry Eagleton as a jumping off point. Next, we examine the theory of cultural hegemony developed by Antonio Gramsci. Finally, we look at Plato's allegory of the cave. <br /><br />This video might be of interest if you're new to critical theory, the concept of ideology, or if you're following along with the video lecture series for Intro to Popular Culture. <br /><br />Instagram: @prof.mhale<br />Twitter: @MatthewLHale1<br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.digital-pedagogy.com">https://www.digital-pedagogy.com</a><br /><br />0:00 - 0:08 - Introduction <br />0:09 - 2:56 - Defining Ideology <br />2:57 - 3:29 - The Life of Antonio Gramsci <br />3:30 - 4:25 - Cultural Hegemony <br />4:26 - 4:45 - Stupid Meme about a guy holding a toaster<br />4:46 - 7:10 - How the Dominant Ideology Naturalizes and Obscures Itself <br />7:11 - 9:12 - Plato's Allegory of the Cave <br />9:13 - 9:33 - Wrap Up <br />9:34 - 9:47 - Blooper{% endraw %}
