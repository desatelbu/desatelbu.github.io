{% raw %}Right now, there is a large inventory of individual sewage systems in our municipality.<br />Therefore, many changes are now being made here in our area.<br />This is one of many upcoming projects that are about sewer systems, just so you know;)<br />I will try to make the videos as varied as possible.<br /><br />This system is very environmentally friendly.<br />The plant does not need to be emptied, all waste is broken down by micro-life and plants and the clean water goes back into the ground.<br />The last tank is a phosphorus trap, in it it's a bag that has to be exchanged, but I do not know the intervals.<br /><br />Excavator: Cat 313FL with a Engcon EC219 + integrated grab QS60GR20<br />Wheel Loader: Cat 924 (driver: Pontus)<br />On The Ground: Pontus &amp; Hedblom<br />Camera: GoPro Black 7<br />Video Editing: iMovie<br />Location: Sweden<br />Instagram: m_hedblom<br /><br />FAQ: <br />T.Ö Hansson is not my company, in my company it's just me. <br />I am hired as a machine operator by T.Ö. Hansson and I'm paid per hour.<br />They have 3-4 people out in the field + me and Åberg who have our own companies.<br />That means that I own none of the machines you see in videos and I don't know all the machine specifications. <br />It's also why I never answer price questions, it's between T.Ö Hansson and the customer.<br /><br />Chapters/Music:<br />00:00 Intro<br />00:50 Hara Noda: The Flamingoes<br />06:08 El Flaco Collective: Tints<br />10:22 Arc De Soleil: Trying to Escape<br /><br />All the music comes from Epidemic Sound. <br />Check them out at: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/o5ad5w/">https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/o5ad5w/</a>{% endraw %}
