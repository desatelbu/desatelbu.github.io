{% raw %}A video of how we make it - we will discover together<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/-neBVk79QkE">https://youtu.be/-neBVk79QkE</a><br />Many have asked how I make my videos with just an iPhone. So Iâ€™ll show you all of the equipment I use, including tripods, gimbals, microphones and iPhone accessories. Along with how I plan, record and edit everything for my channel each week. Hopefully everything I show will help you with how to make YouTube videos with a phone.{% endraw %}
