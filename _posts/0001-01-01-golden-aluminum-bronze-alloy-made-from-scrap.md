{% raw %}Aluminum Bronze is definitely one of my favorite alloys to make as it comes out just like Brass &amp; Nordic gold without the worry of the Zinc problems. Today I grab an ugly little piece of electric motor break in down and make some Al Bronze. Typically the mixture is around 90/10% Copper Aluminum  but today i give it a 94/6% mix for a more golden colour. So sit back and enjoy todays video and ill see all you guys next friday.<br />******<br /> 20% OFF RINGS &amp; BRACLETS   Simply use the code word   DION   on this link <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gthic.com/?aff=27">https://gthic.com/?aff=27</a> <br />This ring company makes bracelets and other things and I will only ever back a company I believe in and these rings are of the highest quality they are absolutely awesome!<br />**********<br />5% Off a furnace ,Burner, Full set up or Forge and a heap of start up info and links  email me on bigstackddddd@mail.com<br />*********<br /> Now Guys if you Feel like  supporting the channel it wont cost you a cent as you can Simply just  donate some of your time.

I start with 150 grit then go through the following Grits 240-400-800 Then once I get to the following Grits I use a small squirt of WD-40 1200-1500-2000-2500-3000. The WD40 helps to lubricate the discs and stops the sanding disk binding up with the metal powder . Then after that I use my buffer wheel on my bench grinder to get a perfect mirrored finish on it.<br /><br />*****<br /><br />#bigstackDCasting<br />#ASMR<br />#MeltingCopper<br />#MeltingMetal<br /> #bigStackD<br />#TrashToTreasure<br />#dumpsterdiving<br />#scrapyard<br />Golden Aluminum Bronze From Scrapyard Salvage - Trash To Treasure - ASMR Metal Melting - BigStackD{% endraw %}
