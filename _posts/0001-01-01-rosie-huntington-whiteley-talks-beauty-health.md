What's your favourite lip product?<br />&quot;I'm all about the three new lipsticks we are launching this spring,&quot; says Rosie. &quot;They are intense, bold colours.&quot;<br /><br />7.

Favourite music to workout to?<br />To workout Rosie listens to her trainer Simone de La Roux's playlist on Spotify which is very high energy. To relax she listens to The XX, London Grammar and Classical music (although worries that makes her sound old!).<br /><br />8. What's your worst beauty mishap?<br />Rosie describes a terrible time when her whole body was cast for a film of Mad Max and they put paper mache all over her.
