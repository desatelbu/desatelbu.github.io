{% raw %}Palestinian gunman identified as member of Hamas' political wing killed 1 and injured 4 Israeli civilians in Jerusalem on Sunday. The assailant used an automatic weapon to shoot at civilians from short-range. The man killed by the terrorist was named Eliyahu David Kay, 26, who was employed at the Western Wall as a tour guide. He recently immigrated from South Africa. Meanwhile, Hamas, the Islamist terror group, has praised the terrorist and called for more attacks. In a separate incident, a 67-year-old Israeli civilian was stabbed by an 18-year-old Palestinian in Jaffa. Last week, the United Kingdom's parliament made the decision to designate the entirety of Hamas as a terrorist organisation. The US, Canada, the European Union and Israel have already done so. AIJAC strongly supports the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security (PJCIS) recommendation that Australia join its allies in designating Hamas in its entirety as a terrorist group.{% endraw %}
