{% raw %}Join us as we follow Kaio through the city of Berlin, his chosen home. We start the day at his apartment, look at some treasures, get in a good session at Alexanderplatz, and hit some spots as he is filming for his Thrasher part and wrap the day up the way we started it, by doing some fun slappies. We love Kaio and his good energy. Enjoy! <br /><br />Filming: Torsten Frank<br />Editing: Bennet Rahm<br />Motion Graphics: Stephan PÃ¶hlmann <br /><br />#berlin #followed <br /><br />Get our books &amp; apparel collection here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pocketskatemag.com/shop/">https://pocketskatemag.com/shop/</a><br /><br />Feel free to subscribe to our channel and follow us on Instagram:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/pocketskatemag">http://www.instagram.com/pocketskatemag</a> <br /><br />Our Website:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.pocketskatemag.com">http://www.pocketskatemag.com</a>{% endraw %}
