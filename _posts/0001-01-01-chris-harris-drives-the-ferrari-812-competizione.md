{% raw %}Chris Harris goes for a drive in the new Ferrari 812 Competizione at the Fiorana Circuit in Maranello, the latest limited edition V12 Ferrari. This particular car weighs in as the highest revving and most powerful V12 the marque have ever produced.<br /><br />We would like to apologise for the poor sound quality, but this was a smash and grab exercise without our normal crew! Having said that, any footage of a Ferrari is good footage, surely! - CH<br /><br />--<br /><br />Follow Collecting Cars on:<br /><br />Auction platform - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.collectingcars.com​​​​​">https://www.collectingcars.com​​​​​</a><br />Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/collectingcars​...">https://instagram.com/collectingcars​...</a><br />Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/collectingcars_​​​​​">https://twitter.com/collectingcars_​​​​​</a><br />Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/collectingcarsltd">https://facebook.com/collectingcarsltd</a>{% endraw %}
