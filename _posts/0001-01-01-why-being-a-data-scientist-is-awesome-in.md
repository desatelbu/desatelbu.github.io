{% raw %}In the last video, we talked about why you should not be a data scientist. If you still think that data science could be the right career path for you then this video is for you! In this video, we're going to flip it around and talk about why being a data scientist is awesome! Which I clearly think it is since I'm here talking to you still as a full time data scientist :) <br /><br />Timestamps <br /> <br />00:00 Intro<br />00:31 6 figure entry level salary<br />02:21 freedom to explore <br />03:32 applicable to many industries <br />04:41 never get bored <br />06:40 specialization <br />08:26 easily transferable to other roles <br />_____________________________________________________________________<br />SQL for tech and data science interviews course with 10 mock interviews: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2TSqGsG">https://bit.ly/2TSqGsG</a> <br /><br />**365 Data Science: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3d7rOPE">https://bit.ly/3d7rOPE</a> (link for 57% discount for their complete data science training)<br /><br />**Check out StrataScratch for SQL interview prep: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://stratascratch.com/?via=tina">https://stratascratch.com/?via=tina</a><br /><br />Real SQL interview question walkthrough series: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Td-cmLfQ7uU&amp;list=PLVD3APpfd1tuXrXBWAntLx4tNaONro5dA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Td-cmLfQ7uU&amp;list=PLVD3APpfd1tuXrXBWAntLx4tNaONro5dA</a><br />_____________________________________________________________________<br />instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/hellotinah/">https://www.instagram.com/hellotinah/</a><br /><br />linkedin: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tinaw-h/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/tinaw-h/</a> <br /><br />discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/5mMAtprshX">https://discord.gg/5mMAtprshX</a><br /><br />study with Tina channel:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI8JpGrDmtggrryhml8kFGw">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI8JpGrDmtggrryhml8kFGw</a><br /><br />livestreaming google calendar:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3wvPzHB">https://bit.ly/3wvPzHB</a><br />_____________________________________________________________________<br />Other videos you might be interested in<br /><br />Why you should not be a data scientist: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOZ8MxFw8TQ&amp;t=36s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOZ8MxFw8TQ&amp;t=36s</a><br /><br />Why I work so hard (despite having a 'good' job): <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPYT8BaTqoA&amp;t=112s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPYT8BaTqoA&amp;t=112s</a><br /><br />How I would learn to code (if I could start over): <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHPGeQD8TvI&amp;t=84s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHPGeQD8TvI&amp;t=84s</a><br />______________________________________________________________________<br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2UXDak6o7rBm23k3Vv5dww/?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2UXDak6o7rBm23k3Vv5dww/?sub_confirmation=1</a><br />______________________________________________________________________<br />About me <br /><br />Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :) <br />______________________________________________________________________<br />Contact<br /><br />youtube: youtube comments are by far the best way to get a response from me! <br />linkedin: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tinaw-h/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/tinaw-h/</a> <br />email for business inquiries only: hellotinah@gmail.com <br /><br />If you're reaching out through linkedin, please leave a youtube comment just letting me know that you reached out :) <br />______________________________________________________________________<br />Links marked with * are tracking links that track traffic that comes from my channel.
