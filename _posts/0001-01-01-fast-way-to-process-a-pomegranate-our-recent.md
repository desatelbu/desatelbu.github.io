{% raw %}Our recent cost comparison was $2.50 for a 4.4 oz. container of arils, and $1.50 for a whole fruit, which yielded nearly 14 ounces. Do the math - it's better to do it yourself! <br /><br />Do you love to eat Pomegranates but hate the mess of processing them?  Or, do you eat a lot of processed pomegranate, but want to save A LOT of money processing your own?  Here's an easy way to process a pomegranate.<br /><br />You can use a short knife to cut the pomegranate, scoring to remove the top, as well as making shallow cuts top to bottom along the sides, aligned with the inside sections of the fruit. You can then split up the peel and the sections inside and get them to drop out quickly using a flat wooden spoon to dislodge all the arils. It's a fast, fun, and delicious way to enjoy pomegranates!<br /><br />Watch as DFJ shows you how the professionals do it - and in no time at all, you'll have a bowl of delicious pomegranate arils ready to eat. No mess, no fuss.{% endraw %}
