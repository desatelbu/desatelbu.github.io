This is because no one should miss Heaven because s/he lacks the knowledge of Holiness as revealed in the Holy Bible (Hosea 4:6). Also, the Holy Bible teaches that “freely ye have received, freely give” (Matthew 10:8b). This means that the Gospel of Christ is a FREE GOSPEL and should be made available for FREE for everyone so that no one should have any excuse to give for not making it to Heaven. We look forward to seeing you in Heaven in Jesus Name. Amen.{% endraw %}
