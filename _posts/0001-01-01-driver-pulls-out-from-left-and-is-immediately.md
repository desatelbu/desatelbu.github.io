{% raw %}I think perhaps this driver may not have seen me passing the bus initially but they had decided to pull out and so carried on anyway.  Even though I overtook them immediately and with all my lights there is no way they could have missed that, I looked over as they came alongside and there was no reaction at all from the driver or any of the passengers.  Nobody in the car would look over or wave or acknowledge my presence at all.{% endraw %}
