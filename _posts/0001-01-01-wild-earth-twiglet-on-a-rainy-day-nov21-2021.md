{% raw %}Twiglet is by himself on this rainy day ~ a sign that the owlet's development is right on track. Mom  and Dad will remain close and Mom will be returning to the nest in awhile. She needs to take a break and also to hunt for herself even if it is an odd hour for an Owl to be hunting. She most likely still stays on the nest at night with her  little one. Twiglet may be looking wet but he is just fine-doing what all birds do-waiting for the rain to stop and hoping Mom returns with some food!<br /><br />Many thanks to Wild Earth and its partnering Game Parks.{% endraw %}
