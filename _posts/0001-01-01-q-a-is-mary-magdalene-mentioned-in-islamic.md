{% raw %}&quot;Who is Mary Magdalene? Is there any mention of her in Islamic sources?&quot; Dr. Shabir Ally says she isn't mentioned at all in the Quran or hadith literature. He explains that she's known from the gospels to be a prominent disciple of Jesus, on whom be peace. She is one of the first (or perhaps the only one) to find the tomb of Jesus empty after Jesus was said to have been entombed. The apocryphal gospels raise questions about whether Jesus was married to her, but Dr. Shabir Ally says there's no actual evidence that he was married at all.<br /><br />If you enjoy this video, please support our work financially by visiting our website <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.quranspeaks.com">http://www.quranspeaks.com</a> or via etransfer to igive@quranspeaks.com <br /><br />► DONATE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.quranspeaks.com/">http://www.quranspeaks.com/</a><br />► SUBSCRIBE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=quranspeaks">https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=quranspeaks</a><br /><br />COMMENT, LIKE and SHARE<br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.Facebook.com/LetTheQuranSpeak">http://www.Facebook.com/LetTheQuranSpeak</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.Instagram.com/QuranSpeaks.tv">http://www.Instagram.com/QuranSpeaks.tv</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.Twitter.com/Quran_Speaks">http://www.Twitter.com/Quran_Speaks</a>{% endraw %}
