{% raw %}Lyrics:<br /><br />I want a girl who likes my band<br />Who laughs at my jokes and who'll hold my hand<br />And if I feel unwell she'll sympathise<br />And she won't go home with other guys<br />I want true love and a bond that lasts<br />And I don't think that is too much to ask.<br /><br />I want a girl who's got two eyes<br />And a nose and a mouth and who knows her own mind<br />I could buy her things and take her out<br />And we'll have so much to talk about<br />I want true love and a bond that lasts<br />I don't think that... it isn't a lot to ask.<br /><br />As I pull out the personals<br />Romance in a catalogue.<br />Thinking what am I doing wrong?<br />I'm without emotion.<br /><br />They say that love finds it way to you.<br />That it'll strike when you're on the tube.<br />But what if you don't commute?<br /><br />I want a girl who likes my band<br />Who laughs at my jokes and who'll hold my hand<br />And if I feel unwell she'll sympathise<br />And she won't go home with other guys<br />I want true love and a bond that lasts<br />And I don't think that is too much to ask.<br />I want a girl but they don't want me<br />'Cause I won't shut up when they watch TV<br />And I can't accept that we're not the same<br />With the raised eyebrow at my video game<br />If I could just try not to laugh<br />At her favourite songs... it isn't a lot to ask.<br /> <br />As I pull out the personals<br />Romance in a catalogue.<br />Thinking what am I doing wrong?<br />I'm without emotion.<br /><br />When my voice is a dial tone<br />Just a noise as I rattle on<br />I think I'm better off on my own.<br /> <br />I want a girl who doesn't exist<br />She's an idea, I'm the idealist<br />And I won't back down or compromise<br />Cause I don't want a life that's based on lies<br /><br />I know I get so wrapped up in all that I want.<br />But you could be anything, you'd still be the one.<br /><br />Just the one, just the one.<br />I don't want the world, I just want one.<br />Just the one, my only one.{% endraw %}
