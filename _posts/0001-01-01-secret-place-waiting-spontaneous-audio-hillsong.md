{% raw %}“Secret Place / Waiting (Spontaneous)” from Hillsong Worship’s live album &quot;These Same Skies&quot;, led by Chris Davenport &amp; Brooke Ligertwood.<br /><br />Whether in the northern or southern hemisphere, these same skies unite us, all of God’s children, as many as the stars in the sky, just as the Lord promised Abraham. It is under these same skies that Christ’s church, His body on earth, exists today. Though separated by oceans and borders the mandate of Hillsong Worship continues under these same skies. One in heart and spirit, unified in mission and cause—to glorify the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, to build His Church, and to serve His Church with the new song.<br /><br />Listen to &quot;These Same Skies&quot;: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://worship.lnk.to/thesesameskiesID">https://worship.lnk.to/thesesameskiesID</a><br />Watch the latest from Hillsong Worship here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://hillsong.lnk.to/ytplaylist">https://hillsong.lnk.to/ytplaylist</a><br />Click to subscribe to our channel here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://worship.lnk.to/subscribe">https://worship.lnk.to/subscribe</a><br /><br />Stay connected<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/hillsongworship">https://instagram.com/hillsongworship</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/hillsongworship">https://facebook.com/hillsongworship</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/hillsongworship">https://twitter.com/hillsongworship</a><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://hillsong.com/worship">https://hillsong.com/worship</a><br /><br />Secret Place<br />Words and Music by <br />Chris Davenport<br />© 2021 Hillsong MP Songs<br />CCLI: 7184446<br /><br />VERSE 1: <br />I remember the beginning<br />When I found the secret place<br />Don’t know why it felt familiar<br />But I knew it right away<br />There were times it seemed so simple<br />And sometimes so unsure<br />But not a moment was ever wasted<br />Knelt behind those closed doors<br /><br />VERSE 2:<br />‘Cause the secret place is secret<br />That’s where it gets its name<br />It’s not hiding but it’s hidden<br />Far from all religious games<br />No it won’t bring recognition<br />Or get called up on a stage<br />‘Cause the melody is sacred<br />You sing in the secret place<br /><br />VERSE 3:<br />It’s an open invitation<br />No words you have to say<br />If you want it you can get there<br />There’s a thousand different ways<br />There’s no glory in the method<br />None are right and none are wrong<br />You just put your trust in Jesus<br />And then start to sing along<br /><br />VERSE 4:<br />‘Cause just as you are you’re welcome<br />There’s no part you have to play<br />Doesn’t need to be impressive<br />Couldn’t do that anyway<br />‘Cause when it gets too complicated<br />That melody will fade<br />But if you take the time to listen<br />You can hear heaven’s refrain<br /> <br />VERSE 5:<br />There’ll be days that it feels distant<br />So far beyond my reach<br />Like my failures locked the entrance<br />And my spirit lost the keys<br />But the beauty of the secret<br />That I’m so grateful for<br />Is that Your presence doesn’t need me<br />To kick down an open door<br /><br />VERSE 6:<br />So I’m running to the secret<br />I’m going there today<br />Got no reason not to worship<br />And get undignified again<br />There’s no time for inhibitions<br />Or to care what people say<br />I won’t waste another minute<br />Take me to the secret place<br /><br />#secretplace #thesesameskies #hillsongworship{% endraw %}
