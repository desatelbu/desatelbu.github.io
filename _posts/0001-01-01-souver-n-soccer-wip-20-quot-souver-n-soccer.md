{% raw %}&quot;Souverän Soccer&quot; is my wip Super Formation Soccer (SNES) like game for unaccelerated stock Amiga 1200 / CD32 and compatible machines.<br /><br />Because I didn't have enough time to get into zen-mode for the player AI I decided to do a much simpler yet also very important part of the game for now:<br /><br />The player animation system and all player-running animations have been added.<br /><br />The animation drawings aren't final though, it's just my first shot. The anim frames are taken almost 1:1 from a sprite sheet which I bought for the game at project start. These graphics have a black outline which is unnecessary for my purpose and actually kind of disturbs the scaling algorithm, so the quality is needlessly lowered. At some point I'll take my favorite pixel editor and get rid of that outline, maybe for the next wip video ;) Also, for some animations an extra frame won't hurt.<br /><br />Anyway, all the internals of the anim system and its integration are pretty much done. <br />All pre-scaling and team-coloring is handled during first load. The player's shadow is now procedurally added after scaling for best quality.<br /><br />Note that I sped up video playback by x5 during booting and loading.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Daytona675x{% endraw %}
