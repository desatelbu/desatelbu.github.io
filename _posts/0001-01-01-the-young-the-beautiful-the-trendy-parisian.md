{% raw %}Young, beautiful, and trendy Parisians working low-key outfits on their down time. Simple and effortlessly chic outfits...just a pair of jeans and a simple top in most cases such as the outfits at 0:29, 0:35, 1:41, and 2:51.  Monochrome jumpsuit at 1:53 and dresses at 1:21 and 1:27. What you will notice in each of these images is that very few pieces complete the look, accessories are kept to a minimum so that the woman can shine. With minimal makeup and the no-makeup look they all look effortlessly fabulous and feel like natural beauties! On a side note, the ladies at 2:17 are celebrating &quot;enterrement de vie de jeune fille&quot; which literally means &quot;funeral of life as a girl&quot; which is our &quot;bachelorette party&quot;. The young crowd at 3:12 enjoying a music festival. Enjoy and have a beautiful week!<br />Ã€ Suivre{% endraw %}
