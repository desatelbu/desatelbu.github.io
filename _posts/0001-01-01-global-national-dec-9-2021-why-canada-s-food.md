{% raw %}On this episode of Global National: Canada's Food Price Report predicts food will become even more expensive in 2022, with prices rising by up to seven per cent. Ross Lord breaks down how much family food bills could end up being, which products will become pricier, and how it could impact buying habits. And Anne Gaviola explains what's fuelling the inflation.<br /><br />Also, despite millions of COVID-19 rapid test kits given to provinces across Canada, very few have been used so far due to low distribution. Mike Le Couteur reports on how doctors are trying to make the tests more accessible. <br /><br />As the COVID-19 pandemic drags on, the numbers of postponed surgeries continues to pile up, leaving some patients in a critical waiting game. Heather Yourex-West looks at the toll it's taking and what some people are willing to pay to get treatment sooner. <br /><br />Plus, an investigation by Auditor General Karen Hogan has found significant failings in the enforcement of testing and quarantining travellers entering Canada. David Akin explains the findings, as uncertainty about the Omicron variant rises. <br /><br />And despite attempts to dislodge it, a huge barge remains marooned on a Vancouver beach after extreme weather in November blew the vessel into the seawall. But why are people so fascinated and fond of it? Jordan Armstrong explains the new craze that's barged into the hearts of Vancouverites. <br /><br />For more info, please go to <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://globalnews.ca">https://globalnews.ca</a><br />Subscribe to Global News Channel HERE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/20fcXDc">http://bit.ly/20fcXDc</a><br />Like Global News on Facebook HERE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/255GMJQ">http://bit.ly/255GMJQ</a><br />Follow Global News on Twitter HERE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1Toz8mt">http://bit.ly/1Toz8mt</a><br />Follow Global News on Instagram HERE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2QZaZIB">https://bit.ly/2QZaZIB</a><br />#GlobalNews #GlobalNational{% endraw %}
