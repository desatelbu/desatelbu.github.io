{% raw %}When I tell people that I teach high school, the reaction I most often get is &quot;Oh that must be so difficult - teenagers are awful!&quot;  When I tell them that I teach Environmental Science, people often say what a downer that must be, because the world is in bad shape. Most times, people are not interested in the reality, that the world is improving and teenagers truly rock.  We have teenagers across the country and at AHS who are already changing the world. My talk will highlight some of these amazing stories and how teenagers are why I have hope that the future will be bright. Mrs. Williamson is a teacher at American Heritage who has been teaching Environmental Science for over 10 years in both public and private schools. She is sponsor of the green team and a member of the AHS Environmental Initiative. In addition, she won a FL FDA Golden Shovel award for the Seed-to-table Sustainable Garden program she started. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
