{% raw %}SpaceX Valuation Sky Rocketed thanks to a new round of funding partially inspired by the success of the starlink and starship systems under development. This comes directly after the Elon Musk Led company just had an unsuccessful landing of starship sn9 and before sn10 is set to launch next week. Elon has teased that a Starlink ipo could be in the works and a video on that will be coming out soon.<br /><br />This channel goes over all things related to the stock market, business, and posts made on wall street bets. This channel goes over crazy options purchases every day so subscribe for more.<br /><br />#ElonMusk #SpaceX #Starlink #Starship #sn10<br /><br />Background Video was used from this video that has creative commons license:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1ZGL9_N6v0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1ZGL9_N6v0</a>{% endraw %}
