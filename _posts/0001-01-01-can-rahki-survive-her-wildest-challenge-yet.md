After working out relentlessly over the last few weeks, Rahki is ready for some time away from the gym, and her friend Moody invites her out for a day at Everglades Holiday Park. Little does she know that Moody has something tucked up his sleeve. Rahki told Truly: “I don’t know why Moody would try and bring me to the Everglades. People know me as being a super tough person in the gym, but nobody really knows that I’m terrified of alligators.” Making sure she sticks to her strict workout routine, Moody has set up two extreme challenges which will get her up close and personal to some reptiles. Pushing herself to face her fears is a big challenge for Rahki, who has already been through so much this year after losing her mom and the traumatic birth of her son, Power. She added: “Facing my fears is very important to me because the worst things that could ever happen in my life just happened. I feel like my world crashed down, but now I’m charging towards fear.” With the alligators watching on, will Rahki be able to get through her latest extreme workout?<br /><br />Rahki’s Instagram: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/rahkigiovanni/">https://www.instagram.com/rahkigiovanni/</a> <br /><br />Mahmoud’s Instagram: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/xmahmouddx/">https://www.instagram.com/xmahmouddx/</a><br /><br />Thanks to Everglades Holiday Park <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.evergladesholidaypark.com/">https://www.evergladesholidaypark.com/</a> <br /><br />Videographer: Carlos De Varona<br />Producers: Adam Fleet, Ruby Coote<br />Editor: Helen Mckee<br /><br />Truly is on TikTok! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show">https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show</a><br /><br />Now you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES">http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES</a><br /><br />Click here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! <br />Truly - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow">https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow</a><br />Born Different - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/">https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/</a><br />Shake My Beauty - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/">https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/</a><br />Hooked On The Look - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/">https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/</a><br />Love Don't Judge - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/">https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/</a><br />Beastly - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/">https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/</a><br />Ridiculous Rides - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/">https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/</a><br />Dog Dynasty - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/">https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/</a><br /><br />For more amazing content, click here!<br />Beastly: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA</a><br />Barcroft Cars: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured">https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured</a>{% endraw %}
