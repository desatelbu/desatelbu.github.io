{% raw %}It's taken BMW 9 years to bring us their second electric car offering following the 2013 i3, but is the new iX3 any good? Unlike the i3, which was one of the first pure electric cars to come from legacy car makers, the iX3 looks just like their X3 ICE car, but with a battery. <br /><br />The iX3 is a big, heavy SUV but it's enjoyable to drive, is very comfortable and when it comes to range, you get a lot of bang for you buck as this car is super efficient. It has all the luxury you would expect from a BMW but it's also a very sensibly powered electric family car and we applaud them for understanding not all electric cars have to be jaw-droppingly fast.<br /><br />We're a bit torn with this car - we really like it, it's easy and pleasant to drive, but it's missing those EV benefits you get if you design an electric car from the ground up.
