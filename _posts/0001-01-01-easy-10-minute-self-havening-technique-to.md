Justin Bieber is a fan of Havening Techniques and talks about it in his current YouTube documentary series.<br />Please follow her on a short and very powerful Havening Technique for events that you have experienced that have left you feeling agitated or anxious. Please only work with small events that are not deep-seated traumas. They must be dealt with by a certified Havening Practitioner so that you are supported if unexpected or deeply hidden negative emotions arise.<br />In this video, Michele will guide you through a mind programming technique called the Havening Technique. It is a powerful psycho sensory process to help you clear any past limiting experiences that may be holding you back in the present. She’s going to take you through a thought process that will help you identify specific areas of your life where you feel blocked. She will coach you towards feeling happier, focusing on success, releasing your true potential,  and creating more abundance in your life. To fully benefit from this life-changing training, make sure that you’re lying down or sitting comfortably in a quiet place, preferably with your eyes closed.
