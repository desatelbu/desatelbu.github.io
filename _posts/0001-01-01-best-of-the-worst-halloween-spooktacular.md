{% raw %}Booooo! It's Halloween! You know what that means: a normal Best of the Worst episode except it's on a different set. This time, the gang is stuck in an Evil Dead-esque cabin to talk about three almost-movies, including one from the terrifying director of Shark Exorcist. Oh no!!!!{% endraw %}
