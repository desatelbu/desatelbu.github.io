{% raw %}My name is Brooklinn, on November 3rd, 2020, I got attacked by a pit Bull, he took of my upper lip and parts of my nose. It’s been one year later and I’m just now starting to have surgeries to fix my face. This is the first week after surgery. I’m sharing to help anyone going through any different and difficult situation. Go hug someone you love today.{% endraw %}
