{% raw %}For what they are, compost bins can be pretty pricey. They're often quite bulky too. This is how I made an affordable and compact compost system. My entire system would have only cost $55.47, if the bins that I have linked below had been available when I was filming this video.<br /><br />Plastic bin from Bunnings:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bunnings.com.au/decor-60l-black-dome-bin-base-only_p0182871">https://www.bunnings.com.au/decor-60l-black-dome-bin-base-only_p0182871</a><br />With lid sold separately:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bunnings.com.au/decor-60l-dome-bin-lid-only_p0182872\">https://www.bunnings.com.au/decor-60l-dome-bin-lid-only_p0182872\</a><br /><br />By way of comparison, this is what a purpose-built compost bin costs!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bunnings.com.au/tumbleweed-150l-gedye-compost-bin_p3160036">https://www.bunnings.com.au/tumbleweed-150l-gedye-compost-bin_p3160036</a><br /><br />Tip (that I forgot to mention in the video): If you wait until each bin is full before starting to fill up the next one, then after while you will have a system where you always have ready-to-use compost and always room for more scraps! Mine was a bit all over the place because I didn't quite have enough capacity to get the system going properly.{% endraw %}
