{% raw %}10 States with the MOST Freedom.<br /><br /> Do you feel free in your state? Do you have enough personal freedom or does your state regulate things a little too much like guns, gambling, marriage, the devil lettuce, education, high incarceration rates, strict nudity, and sexuality laws like restricting nude beaches and strip clubs? <br />Today’s list is about what States are considered to have the most personal freedom. <br />Keep in mind this isn’t regulatory or fiscal freedoms where taxes, land use, labor, or occupational freedoms come into play. We are just looking at where the people feel the government is stopping them from what they consider the pursuit of happiness. <br /><br /><br /><br />🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹<br /> 🔶My Other Channels: <br />    🟥  On This Day  <br />    <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs9MGJ6xVKLKG_YsQkQNLjg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs9MGJ6xVKLKG_YsQkQNLjg</a><br />    🟥     According To Briggs <br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBkk4NYCe6f7sW4TU6_YO-w">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBkk4NYCe6f7sW4TU6_YO-w</a><br />   Our website:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.worldaccordingtobriggs.com/">https://www.worldaccordingtobriggs.com/</a><br />   <br />Audible Free Trial by Amazon:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3DeElv8">https://amzn.to/3DeElv8</a><br /> (Affiliate Link)  I get a small payment for people that sign up.
