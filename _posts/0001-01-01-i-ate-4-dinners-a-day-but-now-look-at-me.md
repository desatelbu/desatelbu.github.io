Telsah was always a bigger child and developed a bad relationship with food at an early age. Her calorie count was between 6,000 and 7,000 per day and was filled with unhealthy junk food. Telsah told truly: &quot;I used food as a comfort for anything, whether it was sadness, happiness, scared, stress, it didn't matter what it was.&quot; This unhealthy binge eating led to her weight gain and despite showing a happy exterior, Telsah kept her real feelings hidden way inside. Telsah said: &quot;The feeling of me being scared to die at such a young age, me being almost 300lbs, eating three to four dinners a day... I knew I needed to change my life.&quot; At the age of 18, Telsah decided to act and made the life changing decision to have vertical gastric sleeve surgery. With a lot of hard work, changing her diet and working closely with a personal trainer, Telsah dropped an incredible 120lbs and has finally got the body and confidence she always wanted. Telsah added &quot;When I look in the mirror now, I see me, I see happiness and I see a fit, healthy, happy person. You have to have faith in yourself and just go with it.&quot; <br /><br />Follow Telsah Here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/tels123/">https://www.instagram.com/tels123/</a><br /><br />Videographer: Michael Giannantonio<br />Producers: Adam Fleet, Kim Nguyen<br />Editor: Sarah-Jayne Galpin<br /><br />Truly is on TikTok! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show">https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show</a><br /><br />Now you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES">http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES</a><br /><br />Click here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! <br />Truly - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow">https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow</a><br />Born Different - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/">https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/</a><br />Shake My Beauty - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/">https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/</a><br />Hooked On The Look - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/">https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/</a><br />Love Don't Judge - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/">https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/</a><br />Beastly - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/">https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/</a><br />Ridiculous Rides - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/">https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/</a><br />Dog Dynasty - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/">https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/</a><br /><br />For more amazing content, click here!<br />Beastly: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA</a><br />Barcroft Cars: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured">https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured</a>{% endraw %}
