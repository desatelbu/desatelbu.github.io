{% raw %}This is the last installment of Passage to Wisdom.  Nuff said. See you again in a few weeks.<br /><br />In this series, Passages to Wisdom, John reflects on passages from books that have found particular influence in his life. Today we look at 'The Screwtape Letters' by C.S.  Lewis. This is a classic masterpiece of religious satire that entertains readers with its sly and ironic portrayal of human life and foibles from the vantage point of Screwtape, a highly placed assistant to &quot;Our Father Below.&quot; At once wildly comic, deadly serious, and strikingly original, C.S. Lewis's The Screwtape Letters is the most engaging account of temptationâ€”and triumph over itâ€”ever written. <br /><br />Be sure to subscribe to our YouTube channel BecomeNew.Me and say hello ðŸ‘‹ in the comments.
