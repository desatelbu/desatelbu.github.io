{% raw %}Forced wipe day raiding is the fastest path to riches in Rust - and on this forced wipe, we did exactly that. We were incredibly lucky to discover that almost every single raid was significantly cheaper than we had initially expected, allowing us to plow through any and every starter base we laid our eyes on.<br /><br /><br />After acquiring a ludicrous quantity of raw materials and components, we built up our main base and crafted as many guns and as much gear as we possibly could before contesting the major objectives around the map. It didn't take long for us to establish a feud with another competitive group with a similar gameplan.<br /><br /><br />Provocation is batted back and forth, but ultimately it would be our group to take the first bite.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://silverbackgaming.com.au/">https://silverbackgaming.com.au/</a> - (Use code Kimchi)<br /><br /><br />Join my Discord! - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/R8arxrHHnR">https://discord.gg/R8arxrHHnR</a><br /><br /><br />Kimchi Spotify Playlist - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2NAzeVb94vf2HBqwGJNfyM?si=MxotFa0DR2qVqtL7NfWlFA">https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2NAzeVb94vf2HBqwGJNfyM?si=MxotFa0DR2qVqtL7NfWlFA</a><br /><br /><br />If you want to support me! - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/yourboykimchi">https://www.patreon.com/yourboykimchi</a><br /><br /><br />Thank you to my supporters!<br /><br /><br />MASS<br />DOKKEMAKKE<br />DYLBERT<br />PHAZEDAU<br />OSCAR<br />LIBERANIMUS<br />THOMAS<br />AURORA<br />JUHO<br /><br /><br />-----<br /><br /><br />Rust is at the apex of the survival genre. From the humble hunting bow to the almighty assault rifle, the roleplayer's slum shack to the clan's flawless fortress.<br /><br /><br />In Rust the objective is to survive, but it's up to you what you want to risk in order to thrive. Whether that means fighting outnumbered or putting it all on the line in an explosive heist. Sometimes you win and sometimes you lose, and that's why we love this game.<br /><br /><br />COPYRIGHT DISCLAIMER<br />I do not own any of the music in this video.<br />If you are the owner(s), please do not hesitate to contact me for removal.{% endraw %}
