{% raw %}An irate customer was captured on video throwing soup into a restaurant manager’s face in Temple, Texas. Janelle Broland, 24, says the customer ordered a spicy menudo soup and called to complain that it was so hot it melted the plastic lid of the container. “I of course offered her refunds and was trying to get her either a replacement meal or just something completely different,” she said. But the customer showed up to confront her, causing a scene before throwing the soup in Janelle’s face.{% endraw %}
