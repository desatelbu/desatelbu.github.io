{% raw %}Episode Thirteen of STAYAWAKE is here!!!<br /><br />This episode is slightly different than any of my other episodes. I dive into multiple cases and break down the use of deception detection in each case. Some cases are more obvious then others. I go over some lesser known cases as well as some more well known cases. This is my first attempt at body language break down and this is the first part of a series, I really hope you all enjoy.<br /><br />Thank you again for watching!<br /><br />If you or anybody you know is currently a victim of domestic abuse, addiction, or experiencing suicidal thoughts or ideations.
