{% raw %}Our story starts with the arrival of the Gods on Earth - the people we know historically as the Proto-Sumerians. It is not precisely known when these ancestors of ours came here or why. It is surmised that they arrived here quite some time before the worldwide Deluge, this is long long before recorded history. The arrival of these &quot;gods,&quot; and their incredibly long reigns is reported in their descendant's records, the Sumerians. These records are written on thousands of cuneiform tablets.<br /><br />00:05 The Arrival<br />37:14 The First Cities<br />1:10:09 The Anunnaki<br />1:41:41 The Creation of Humanity<br />2:12:11 The Serpent Gods<br />2:43:32 The Antediluvian Patriarchs<br />3:18:03 The Rephaim Giants<br />3:52:34 The Deluge<br />4:24:04 Ancient Flying Machines<br />4:57:07 Advanced Technology in the Scriptures<br />5:29:53 The Lost City of the Demi Gods<br />6:04:54 The Kadesh Complex <br />6:39:45  Sodom and Gomorrah{% endraw %}
