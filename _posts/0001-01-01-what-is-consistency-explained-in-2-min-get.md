And let me share you a story from my personal life.<br />A few years ago I started to go to the gym. I was very skinny as I used to be a long-distance runner and I wanted to build some muscle.<br />So a read a few books and decided to pick one training program and stick with it. As I started to train many of my friends suggested to switch up my program and try different things.<br />Gladly I didnâ€™t listen to them and instead used my original program. Over time the results were talking for themselves.<br />I was making continuous progress while people who suggested me to try different things were stuck with their progress.<br />The reason why I was getting results was not that I had a better program, but because I was staying consistent over an extended period of time.<br />I apply the same strategy when it comes to my business as well. I donâ€™t chase the latest and greatest secret strategy to grow my business.<br />Instead, I stick with basics. At the moment to grow my digital business Iâ€™m focusing on creating content.<br />There is no magic. If you want to get results you have to stay consistent for an extended period of time and the results will come.<br /><br />I hope that you enjoyed this video and I was able to give you a quick overview of what Consistency is and how you can benefit from it.&quot;     _________________<br /><br />Hi, My name is Janis and Iâ€™m Content Creator and Entrepreneur.<br /><br />One thing that Iâ€™m really passionate about is Time Management.
