You may email me to inquire about discounted pricing for written patterns used in group instruction.<br /><br />✿   Credit: Artists spend countless hours on their designs from concept to completion. I have the utmost respect for other artists, and the time/energy behind their original designs. I will always make a point to give credit where credit is due because I expect the same in return. Of course, in some rare circumstances, artists' beading designs may overlap in certain ways; after all, there are only so many combinations in which beads may be put together. It's possible for artists to simply “be on the same wavelength.” &quot;Great minds think alike,&quot; and all that. :) <br /><br />✿   Selling: You may sell any of the jewelry you have made from my tutorials. If you are able to credit, or tag me, as the designer, it is much appreciated. <br /><br />✿   Commenting: I am honored to have you here! In order to maintain an upbuilding environment, please note that I have no tolerance for hate speech, bullying, spam, or comments that rudely criticize others, or myself, without the intent of offering constructive suggestions. <br /><br /> ✿   Please note: Orchid and Opal is a one-woman show. I (Gina) happily work full-time creating new designs, finished pieces, written patterns, and video content. However, there's so much more work that goes unseen. I state this to let you know (1) how passionate I am about what I do, and (2) as a fellow human, I make mistakes, and do the best I can while also trying to maintain a work-life balance. I always strive to thoroughly research topics, educate myself, and present you with the most accurate content, to the very best of my ability. Thanks for joining me on this creative journey!<br /><br />FTC Disclosure: This information may contain affiliate links, in which I might earn a small commission based on your purchase, at absolutely no cost to you.
