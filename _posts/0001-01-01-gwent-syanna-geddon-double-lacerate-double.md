{% raw %}Absolute carnage here folks. For this, we back up a solid Nature's Gift Symbiosis list with the utter destruction of your opponent's side of the board, with the help of our best girl Syanna, allowing us to double deploy Simlas, which brings out BOTH Lacerates and BOTH Stammelford's Tremors! Much butchery, many satisfaction!<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.playgwent.com/en/decks/guides/282581">https://www.playgwent.com/en/decks/guides/282581</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/fuchsiabriefs">https://www.patreon.com/fuchsiabriefs</a><br /><br /><br />Come for the Gwent, stay for the Gwent.<br /><br />I'm a long time player, and regularly make it to pro rank.
