Well, the flying ones may not exist anymore, but there is something similar to them that exists under the sea… the Goblin Shark… This one looks like it’s a prehistoric beast. It can grow up to 12 feet in length and is equipped with a shovel-like snout, and a thick, strong body, it is able to take down any type of prey it might want! But it doesn’t really like to flaunt its power. This shark is mainly just found right on top of the seabed, feeding on the little fish there, but sometimes, this shark makes the rare venture towards civilization, and if they can get close enough to a human, they could just sink their long, thin and pointy, needle-like teeth right into them… and that bites’, gotta hurt… <br /><br />Sawshark<br /><br />“Regular” sharks, having “regular shark teeth” is scary enough, but what if sharks had a saw for a snout, and could slice you with it? Well, that’s not really much of a “What if”...  That shark already exists, and it’s called the Sawshark. These are mysterious sharks that the world doesn’t know too much about, which somehow makes them look even scarier! When it’s swimming around, this shark is like any other fish, calm and collected, super zen, but when it finds a prey to chase after, it gets very aggressive, very fast… and although humans aren’t usually their prey, if they’re provoked, they don’t care about that can will slice your arm off without warning… so if you ever see a floating saw coming your way in the ocean, just swim the other way…. Fast… <br /><br /><br />Follow Us On Social Media <br /><br /><br /><br />Twitter <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/FactsJunkieYT">https://twitter.com/FactsJunkieYT</a><br /><br />Facebook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/FactsJunkieYT">https://www.facebook.com/FactsJunkieYT</a><br /><br /><br /><br />► For copyright issues, send us an email at: factsjunkie@gmail.com{% endraw %}
