{% raw %}The quads, hamstrings, glutes and adductors will all be working hard during these 20 minutes! We will get a lot of work completed within these 20 minutes but that doesnâ€™t mean rushingâ€¦ infact this workout is all about perfect form, depth and smoothness of the movement. <br /><br />Each set will be a different variation of those lunges! Of course when we complete one side, we must then do the opposite side!<br /><br />Quick, lots of variety and of course challenging!!! <br /><br />Slow paced to allow for focus on technique and alignment! <br /><br />Imagine those hamstrings and glute muscles lengthening as you lower. Ease into the depth of begin with and aim for as deep as you comfortably can from then on! Take your time and donâ€™t worry about how many reps you manageâ€¦ keep a note of how many you do manage per side though to do the same on the opposite!<br /><br />The timer will be on throughout for 45 seconds of work, with 15 seconds rest!<br /><br />Once we complete an exercise on one side, we then perform the opposite side for the next set!<br /><br />All you will need for this leg workout is a pair of dumbbells! The timer I am using for your reference are 15kg each!<br /><br />STATC LUNGE x 2 DUMBBELLS<br />SWITCH SIDE!<br /><br />REAR STEP LUNGE x 2 DUMBBELLS<br />SWITCH SIDE!<br /><br />STEP OUT TO CURTSEY LUNGE<br />SWITCH SIDE!<br /><br />1 1/2 REP STATIC LUNGE<br />SWITCH SIDE!<br /><br />CURTSEY LUNGE x 1 DUMBBELL<br />SWITCH SIDE!<br /><br />FORWARD LEAN LUNGE x 1 DUMBBELL SWITCH SIDE!<br /><br />1/2 REP CURTSEY LUNGE<br />SWITCH SIDE!<br /><br />WIDE TO NARROWER LUNGE<br />SWITCH SIDE!<br /><br />CURTSEY TO LUNGE<br />SWITCH SIDE!<br /><br />STATIC 1/2 REP LUNGES<br />SWITCH SIDE!<br /><br />FINISHER: 15/15/15â€¦.30<br /><br />LUNGE HOLD!<br />REAR STEP (same side)<br />HOLD (same side)<br />SWITCH SIDE HOLD!<br />REAR STEP (same side)<br />HOLD (same side)<br />ALTERNATING REAR STEP LUNGES!<br /><br />My favourite way to finish a workoutâ€¦ bodyweight! <br /><br />When you begin with the heavier sets of compound movements then burn outs with bodyweight only and the bodyweight only becomes very challengingâ€¦ I LOVE it!! Your legs will love it too! ðŸ˜‰<br /><br />Cx<br /><br />Always ensure you warm up before any workout.
