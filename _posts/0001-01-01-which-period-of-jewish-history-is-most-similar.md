{% raw %}In this fascinating lecture, David explores the timeline of Jewish History in search of a period that most resembles the current situation for the Jewish people.<br /><br />Roving from biblical times to an era commonly referred to as the Dark Ages, David analyses the situation of the Jewish people during six distinct historical moments. As part of this analysis, he also compares and contrasts Jewish political and territorial autonomy in the land of Israel with that experienced in contemporary times.<br /><br />Additionally, David outlines the broader geopolitical situations of these eras and how such background considerations reflect our own.<br /><br />The lecture also explores ethical and philosophical factors of interest, ending with an inspiring note for a possible alternative picture for Israel and the Jewish people in the future.<br /><br />David delivered this lecture in 2020 as a Zoom presentation for Chabad Glen Eira. While no visual recording of the talk was made, the above Youtube video combines an audio recording of the lecture with graphics David shared during his Zoom presentation.<br /><br />David is also renowned for his Jewish history lecture, The Whole of Jewish History in One Hour <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/GUlM2a2tsOM">https://youtu.be/GUlM2a2tsOM</a><br /><br />Find more of David Solomon's podcast, with dozens of lectures on Jewish history, the Bible, Jewish philosophy, and Kabbalah at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPZc8ZC7r568Er1pwL8ZiLbU1tV6PFf4L">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPZc8ZC7r568Er1pwL8ZiLbU1tV6PFf4L</a><br /><br />Learn more at davidsolomon.online<br /><br />Images used in this video<br /><br />Youtube cover – comprising images below and a picture of David by Stephan Rohl under CC licensing <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.stephan-roehl.de​">http://www.stephan-roehl.de​</a><br /><br />Large image: Reconstruction of Jerusalem by Cyrus, Darius and Xerxes, Picture from the Bible, Book of Ezra, 1921.
