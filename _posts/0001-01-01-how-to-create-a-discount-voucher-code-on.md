{% raw %}The voucher discount code functionality in Book That In allows you to offer your customers discounts and limit them by an expiry date and/or number of uses.<br /><br />You can create a code that can be used as many times as you want - perhaps hundreds of times (e.g. a sibling discount) or just once (a credit for a particular customer).{% endraw %}
