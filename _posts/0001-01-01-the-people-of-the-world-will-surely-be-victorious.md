{% raw %}&quot;The People of the world will surely be victorious&quot; is a Chinese song about the friendship between Socialist nations and the struggle against US imperialism. <br /><br />(This was inspired by MrOldMajor's video, which I recreated as faithfully as possible with HD footage of the 1959 National Day celebration. I only used the instrumental of one song rather than this song plus the &quot;Workers of the world, Unite&quot; instrumental.){% endraw %}
