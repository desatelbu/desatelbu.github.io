{% raw %}Literary analysis, at its core, is all about observation. <br /><br />Using Orwell’s 1984, I’ll walk you through how to do it. I hope that you’ll feel more confident reading, discussing, and writing about the classics. This kind of literary analysis is my specialty. I love it! :)<br /><br />____________________<br /><br />Want to connect? <br /><br />Official website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://carly-stevens.com">https://carly-stevens.com</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/carlystevensbooks/">https://www.instagram.com/carlystevensbooks/</a><br />Pinterest: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pinterest.com/carlyastevensenglishnerd/">https://www.pinterest.com/carlyastevensenglishnerd/</a><br /><br />Sign up for my author newsletter and you'll get the first two chapters of my upcoming fantasy novel Firian Rising!{% endraw %}
