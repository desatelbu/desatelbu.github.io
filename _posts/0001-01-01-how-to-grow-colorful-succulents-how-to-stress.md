You might not like what I said, maybe because when we hear the word stress, we often associate it with an unpleasant experience like tension, anxiety, problems...<br />So I decided to google the word stress and how it applies to succulents. What I found out really makes sense. It says that...stress is our body's way of responding to any kind of demands or threats. That the stress response is the body's way of protecting ourselves, and when it is working properly, it helps us to stay focused energetic, and alert and in emergency situations, it can even save our lives. Meaning, stress is not always bad. In small doses, it can help us perform under pressure and motivate us to do our best. That is somehow the same with succulents. A little stress and they show their best. Their change of color is their way of protecting themselves. That's what makes succulents unique, stressors that can harm or kill other plants can make succulents more beautiful.<br />There are some succulents that are originally green, that no matter how much you expose them to stress, they will still remain green. So it is best to find out what variety you have.<br /><br />In order to make succulents colorful, you need to expose them to extreme conditions just like in the desert, infertile soil, drought, prolonged exposure to the sun, and even cold temperatures at night.<br /><br />The first tip is the soil. The kind of soil that you use is not only essential to growing colorful succulents but also, it is very important to ensure their survival.{% endraw %}
