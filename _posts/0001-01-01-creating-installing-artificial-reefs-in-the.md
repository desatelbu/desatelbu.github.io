{% raw %}BUCKET LIST CAME TRUE. Always wanted to see and participate in artificial reef projects and today that dream came true. We created sample of Bottle reef at Pura Vida Dive Resort and then show 4 year later AMAZING results. We also participated in reef instillation in Bacong, donated by the Philippine Dental Association. Beautiful. <br /><br />ðŸ“±Follow Social<br />My Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/finn.snow">https://www.instagram.com/finn.snow</a><br />My facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/FinnSnowVlog">https://www.facebook.com/FinnSnowVlog</a><br /><br />ðŸŽ¶Where I get MUSIC (Best for vlogs) : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/XMjaLJ">https://goo.gl/XMjaLJ</a> (Free month trial)<br /><br />ðŸ’¯Join Membership: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/y238rq4v">https://tinyurl.com/y238rq4v</a><br /><br />0:00 - Dream come true<br />0:29 - Our plan today<br />1:00 - 3600 BOTTLES<br />1:44 - Creating Bottle Reef<br />3:50 - Who are we doing this for?<br />5:21 - Arriving in Bacong<br />7:00 - HEAVY Egg Artificial reefs<br />9:01 - Hydraulic cement Reef<br />10:00 - INSTALLING THE REEF<br />11:39 - Justin shares his reef experience<br />12:56 - 4 YEARS LATER AMAZING RESULTS<br /><br />#FinnSnow #ArtificialReef #Ocean{% endraw %}
