{% raw %}I live in Barmouth on the west coast of Wales and create resin pictures.  Started off with shoreline ones using stones/shells/sand and wood from Barmouth Beach, but have progressed into abstract ones.  There are many different styles - it's cool to experiment!   But one thing that holds almost all of them together - they are supersparkly with lots of movement and colour changing.  :D  Sadly, the photos and videos really don't do them justice.
