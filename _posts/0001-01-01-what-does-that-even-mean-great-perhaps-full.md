{% raw %}Full HD and earphones are requested!<br /><br />⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡<br /><br />⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀02/24/2001<br />It's a simplest edit of one of my favourite series ever. I've never been so in love with any other tv show. I've watched it a hundred times already and every time is like the first one. A great path of Alaska and her friends will always be the biggest and the most important story for me. That's why I decided to dedicate edit for my 20th birthday to these great people who inspire my every day.<br />I consider Looking for Alaska to be a story about love, finding themselves, fighting battles every day, but mostly it's about great people that we surround ourselves with. I believe that Great Perhaps Miles is looking for is simple the people we know and love and appreciate in our lives. That's the biggest thing I've learned from LFA. You don't have to seek for a way out of the labyrinth if you have right people with you. Even suffering with them would always be a wonderful thing to do. <br />I've never known such friendship in my life, but now I have some people that I really want to stay in my life as long as it's possible. And I'm grateful for the opportunity to be loved and to be valued, just like I always wanted to be.<br />So yeah, story of Alaska and her friends is really important to me, I can relate to all of them. And today is my birthday which I spend alone unfortunately, but I'm not gonna be mad or sad, I'll be happy about everything that life gives me. <br />I hope you enjoy this video and also I wish you to be alive, be happy, be whoever and whatever you want to be. Life is too short to suffer and make wrong decisions. Choose to be happy for now. <br /><br />⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡<br /><br />Series: Looking for Alaska<br />Song: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoWRs7lXtYE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoWRs7lXtYE</a><br />Coloring: home by alessabelikov (w/ lil changes)<br /><br />#lookingforalaska #fanvidfeed #johngreen{% endraw %}
