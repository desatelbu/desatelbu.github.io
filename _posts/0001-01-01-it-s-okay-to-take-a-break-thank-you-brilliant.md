{% raw %}Thank you Brilliant for partnering with me on this video! If you want to learn more, go to brilliant.org/Mayuko to join me and millions of others! <br /><br />After I finished filming and editing this video, I realized I wanted to add a bit more color and context to this video. Firstly I want to acknowledge that I'm really fortunate to have a job that affords me the opportunity to take breaks, and that I benefit from my own privilege and a supportive family that have helped me to do what I do. I know that a lot of people are in positions that don't afford them this luxury, and my intention is not to promote folks to take breaks even if it damages their livelihoods. There is still a lot of work and labor involved to Do Life especially in our current society, which disproportionately affects people from underrepresented backgrounds. My understanding is that it's harder than ever to gain that emotional, mental, financial, and physical flexibility to live life the way you want to.<br /><br />My intention with this video, therefore, is to have an open dialogue around taking breaks, hustling, and challenging the notion that the only way to success/happiness is to prescribe to the all-consuming lifestyle of only working and going past your limits, all the time. I choose to introspect publicly on topics like this in hopes that there are others that relate to this idea who can share with me their thoughts, and also because doing so is a core part of my creative process as a content creator. Of course, hustling and working hard is absolutely a valid way to live your life if that's what you want. In fact, I think it's still necessary at various points throughout your life, whatever the reason might be for why. But I just wish there were more perspectives, nuances, and options to how to live life than what I've been taught especially from the tech industry, which is why I made this video.<br /><br />üíñ m o r e  m a y u k o üíñ<br />Become a member and support my channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/hellomayuko/join">https://youtube.com/hellomayuko/join</a><br />Merch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://store.hellomayuko.com">https://store.hellomayuko.com</a><br />Muko's Corner Podcast: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://anchor.fm/mayuko-inoue">https://anchor.fm/mayuko-inoue</a><br />Hanko (My iOS Developer Academy): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://academy.hanko.tech">https://academy.hanko.tech</a><br />My Newsletter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://news.hellomayuko.com">https://news.hellomayuko.com</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/hellomayuko/">https://www.instagram.com/hellomayuko/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/hellomayuko">https://twitter.com/hellomayuko</a><br />Japanese Youtube Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClHbaIGALnVB0aoWO-BOpqQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClHbaIGALnVB0aoWO-BOpqQ</a><br /><br />üõ†m y  g e a r üõ†  (affiliate)<br />COMPUTER(similar): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/zgTMbP3">https://geni.us/zgTMbP3</a><br />KEYBOARD: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/2Y17p">https://geni.us/2Y17p</a><br />MOUSE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/QRIoB">https://geni.us/QRIoB</a><br />MONITOR: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/DSpK">https://geni.us/DSpK</a><br />DESK PAD: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2UvPQd1">https://bit.ly/2UvPQd1</a><br />MY AMAZON STORE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/mayuko">https://www.amazon.com/shop/mayuko</a><br /><br />üå±r e s o u r c e süå±<br />Levels.fyi Salary Negotiation service!
