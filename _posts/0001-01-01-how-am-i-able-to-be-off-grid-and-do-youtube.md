{% raw %}I have always wanted to do a &quot;behind the scenes&quot; video, on how I alone make these videos possible. Even though my ambition is to be able to live totally without electricity, it is also to share it and inspire through YouTube (which has been amazing). Therefore I am into solar panels and batteries. I was able to test out EcoFlow's latest cutting edge battery, the DELTA Pro. Which I saw as a perfect opportunity to integrate into this video. This battery can run almost anything at your home. Now I recommend watching the other reviews on YouTube, as mine wasn't even near it's full potential. I just love being able to charge my YouTube gear outdoors fully from the sun, totally off grid.<br /><br />This is my first sponsored video. I like when it contributes to the video, to me and to you. I will only do sponsorships that fits into the video and that I think interests you hopefully as much as it does to me. <br /><br />✔️EcoFlow:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ecoflow.com?aff=150">https://ecoflow.com?aff=150</a><br /><br /><br />This video contains a bit of a preview on my projects and what's to come in the series. You can see me edit the upcoming episode in this video. You will soon see how I have done the roof on the log cabin and later what that hole in the ground is used for. <br /><br />The biggest question in this video:<br />Who is the new dog and is Alice fine?<br /><br />Alice is part of our family and has been with me from time to time, but now she has puppies. I wanted my own 100% of the time dog. To be able to hunt with and go on all of my adventures. So here is &quot;Barr&quot; meaning Spruce Needle in Swedish. He is a German Shorthaired pointer &quot;Vorsteh&quot;, bird dog. <br /><br /><br /><br />DELTA Pro: $1999-$3599<br />DELTA Pro &amp; 400W Solar Panel: $3838-$4798<br /><br />#EcoFlowDELTAPro #PowerStation{% endraw %}
