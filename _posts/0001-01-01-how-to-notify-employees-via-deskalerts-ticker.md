DeskAlerts is a multi-channel notifications software with highly configurable messages.

However, not all messages require such urgency, and the windows popping up on the employee's screen can be quite a distraction.<br /><br />To decrease employee frustration and give them possibility to work on a tasks requiring concentration without being interrupted by pop-ups, DeskAlerts has a special unobtrusive type of messages, which is demonstrated in the video. <br /><br />DeskAlerts client can also optionally include an option to enable special mode, when any non-urgent message will be automatically processed as &quot;unobtrusive&quot; one. This mode can be useful when employee is working on some complex task, or giving a full-screen presentation, to keep him from receiving a pop-ups that will interrupt his workflow.{% endraw %}
