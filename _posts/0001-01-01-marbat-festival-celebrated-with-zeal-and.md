{% raw %}Nagpur (MH), Aug 31 (ANI): A festival of Marbat is being celebrated on August 31. This festival is marked only in Maharashtra’s Nagpur. Thousands of people gathered on the streets and took out a procession of effigies known as Marbats. These are clay effigies Kali (black) and Pilvi (yellow) which are later burnt by the locals as a symbol of evil forces. It’s believed that these statues absorb the negativity and social evils when they are taken through the streets. And then the negativity and social evils are burnt along with the statues.<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />☛ Subscribe to our Youtube Channel - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/k1Aee1">https://goo.gl/k1Aee1</a><br /><br />Enjoy and stay connected with us!!<br />☛ Like us: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/ANINEWS.IN">https://www.facebook.com/ANINEWS.IN</a> <br />☛Follow us : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/ANI">https://twitter.com/ANI</a><br />☛ Visit us : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.aninews.in/">https://www.aninews.in/</a><br />☛ Feedback to Shrawan K Poddar : shrawankp@aniin.com{% endraw %}
