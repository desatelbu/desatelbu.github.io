{% raw %}It might look like madness, but it is quiet and odor free...<br /><br />The Mars II 400W full spectrum grow light has been discontinued.

Suspending the light from the lid conserved space, but it would have been more convenient to suspend the light on pipes or other supports within the can.  Watering was the biggest hassle since I had to use a small jar to carefully pour water into it.  The biggest challenge was lack of vertical clearance.  Three computer fans were sufficient to move air through the trash can (and carbon filter).{% endraw %}
