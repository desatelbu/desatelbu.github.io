{% raw %}A new kind of fascism has taken over America: the merger of corporations and government whereby corporate power dominates.  With the emergence of ever-larger multinational corporations -- due to consolidation facilitated by the Federal Reserve's endless FIAT money -- the corporatocracy has been in a position to literally purchase the U.S. Congress.<br /><br />A James Jaeger Film featuring RON PAUL, Congressman/Presidential Candidate; PAT BUCHANAN, Author/Political Analyst; G. EDWARD GRIFFIN, Author/Producer; EDWIN VIEIRA, Author/Constitutional Attorney and TED BAEHR, Founder of MovieGuide and Christian Film &amp; TV Commission.<br /><br />A result of the corporate purchase of Congress is that many of the nation's &quot;laws&quot; have been re-configured to benefit WE THE CORPORATIONS, rather than WE THE PEOPLE.  &quot;Laws&quot; like NAFTA and GATT resulted in the outsourcing of the U.S. manufacturing base and the destruction of the Middle Class.  This is nothing less than the 1 Percenters abusing the 99 Percenters.  Known as &quot;monopoly capitalism,&quot; &quot;crony capitalism,&quot; &quot;mercantilism,&quot; &quot;globalization,&quot; &quot;the new world order,&quot; and/or &quot;free trade&quot; -- this is NOT your Grandfather's capitalism.<br /><br /><br /><br /> <br /><br />If you liked this film, help us make our new film &quot;MOLON LABE - How the Second Amendment Guarantees America's Freedom&quot;.
