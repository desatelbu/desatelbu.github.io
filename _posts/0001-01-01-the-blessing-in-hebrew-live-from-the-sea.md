{% raw %}Join Joshua Aaron at the Music House singing &quot;The Blessing&quot; in  Hebrew! We do not own the rights to this song, simply sharing in Hebrew. Written by Steven Furtick, Chris Brown, Kari Jobe, Cody Carnes.<br /><br />This is a prayer most cherished among the Jewish people. It's a prayer that GOD Himself taught us to pray over each and every generation. Transliteration and Hebrew below along with Bible reference. <br /><br />Yevarechecha Adonai, V'Yishmerecha<br />Ya'er Adonai Panav Eleycha, ViChoneka<br />Yisa Adonai Panav Eleycha, V'Yasem Lecha Shalom<br /><br />יְבָרֶכְךָ יְהוָה, וְיִשְׁמְרֶךָ<br />יָאֵר יְהוָה פָּנָיו אֵלֶיךָ, וִיחֻנֶּךָּ<br />יִשָּׂא יְהוָה פָּנָיו אֵלֶיךָ, וְיָשֵׂם לְךָ שָׁלוֹם<br /><br />Numbers 6:22 Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, 23 “Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, ‘Thus you shall bless the sons of Israel. You shall say to them: 24 The Lord bless you, and keep you; 25 The Lord make His face shine on you, And be gracious to you; 26 The Lord lift up His countenance on you, And give you peace.’ 27 So they shall [a]invoke My name on the sons of Israel, and I then will bless them.” NASV<br /><br />#theblessing  #beblessed #aaronicblessing #aaronicbenediction #birkathacohenim<br /><br />Filmed at - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.GalileeMusicHouse.com">http://www.GalileeMusicHouse.com</a>{% endraw %}
