{% raw %}Highlights of the weeks play at the 2021 Portugal Masters.<br /><br />► SUBSCRIBE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://et.golf/Subscribe">http://et.golf/Subscribe</a> <br /><br /><br /><br />The Race to Dubai heads to Dom Pedro Victoria Golf Course for the return of this year's Portugal Masters. Matt Wallace has not missed the cut in three Portugal Masters appearances and finished T8 here in his last visit in 2019. The first of his four European Tour wins came on Portuguese soil and he will be hoping to build upon that success. Long-hitting Australian Min Woo Lee has had a breakthrough year with his Rolex win at the Scottish Open. The 23-year-old finished 2nd in his last start and will be pushing for his 3rd European Tour win in Vilamoura. Meanwhile, Andrew Johnston finished T7 at the Mallorca Open to continue a pleasing trend of improving finishes and will be aiming for a good couple of weeks in order to get to the DP World Tour Championship. Other notable contenders include Laurie Canter, Sean Crocker and Sam Horsfield.<br /><br /><br /><br />► WEBSITE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.europeantour.com">http://www.europeantour.com</a><br /><br />► FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/TheEuropeanTour">https://www.facebook.com/TheEuropeanTour</a> <br /><br />► TWITTER <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/EuropeanTour">https://twitter.com/EuropeanTour</a> <br /><br />► INSTAGRAM <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/europeantour">https://instagram.com/europeantour</a>{% endraw %}
