{% raw %}The Superbike dream of a middle class Indian is not new! Here's my Triumph Trident 660 Review and its exhaust note melody after using and riding and experiencing it for a week. The Indian Middle class has been the most ambitious with huge dreams. One of which is buying their first Dream Superbike. Not everyone dreams of a superbike, but the ones that do, know how the passion for bikes, the speed, the adrenaline just never gets any less. <br />Watch my review of the Triumph Trident 660 from the perspective of a rider upgrading to a middle weight superbike for the first time. Do let me know your thoughts about the same in the comments section. Also, share with me your dream bike and when do you plan on buying it.<br /><br />Follow me on instagram at: @theanuragsalgaonkar<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/theanuragsalgaonkar">https://www.instagram.com/theanuragsalgaonkar</a><br /><br />Along with this are meme compilations with close calls, bad drivers, funny people, bad roads, crashes and everything that you'd ask for.<br />These videos are getting so much fun to make.
