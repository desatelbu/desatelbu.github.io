{% raw %}<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Ifreehat20I">http://www.youtube.com/user/Ifreehat20I</a><br /><br />While this account was down I was using another account for those that didn't know, I made a couple new videos and reuploaded a lot of my old.<br /><br />Well anyways it seems that my 3rd strike was repealed and as result this account was reactivated, but I have gained about 2000 subs on my other account and I don't think this account will be the same after 2 months of being down. So i ask you guys this question of whether or not I should continue using this account or leave as it is so nothing happens to it again?(because of the 2 strikes) Either way thank you for all your support{% endraw %}
