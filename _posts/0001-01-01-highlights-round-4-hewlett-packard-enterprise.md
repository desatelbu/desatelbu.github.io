{% raw %}Check out the best shots of the day from Round 4 at the 2021 Hewlett Packard Enterprise Houston Open, featuring Jason Kokrak, Matthew Wolff and Scottie Scheffler among others.<br /><br />SUBSCRIBE to PGA TOUR now: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://pgat.us/vBxcZSh">http://pgat.us/vBxcZSh</a><br /><br /><br /><br />The PGA TOUR heads to Memorial Park Golf Course for the Hewlett Packard Enterprise Houston Open. Carlos Ortiz will be unable to defend his title after withdrawing due to an injury. In 2020, he became the first Mexican player in 42 years to win on the PGA TOUR and was looking to become the first player to defend his title in Houston since Vijay Singh in 2004-05. After missing the cut last week in Mayakoba, Brooks Koepka will be hoping to regain his form at a golf course where he served as a player consultant during renovations in 2020. Matthew Wolff also hopes to return back to the winners circle and build off his current form, where he has back-to-back top 5 finishes and held the 36-hole lead last week. Previous winners Ian Poulter, Lanto Griffin and Russell Henley will be aiming to replicate past performances and lift the trophy once again. With just one more event left in 2021 after Houston, this is prime time for many players to earn valuable FedExCup points.<br /><br /><br /><br />Check out <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pgatour.com">https://www.pgatour.com</a> for complete coverage along with all the latest news, scoring, and stats!<br /><br /><br /><br />Follow PGA TOUR online:<br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/pgatour/">https://instagram.com/pgatour/</a>  <br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/PGATour">https://www.facebook.com/PGATour</a>  <br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/PGATOUR">https://twitter.com/PGATOUR</a><br /><br />SoundCloud: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/pgatour">https://soundcloud.com/pgatour</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Sign up for exclusive coverage - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.pgatourlive.com">http://www.pgatourlive.com</a><br /><br />PGA TOUR Superstore - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.pgatoursuperstore.com/">http://www.pgatoursuperstore.com/</a>{% endraw %}
