{% raw %}Ruth, one of the PLS bridge devs (a pseudonym I’m sure), presented an elevator pitch.<br /><br /><br />A few community members have given this strategy a nickname “The Tripod”<br /><br />It is a way of interacting with all of the Richard Heart projects to maximise profits.<br /><br />This discussion revolves around 3 different steps<br /><br /><br />1st. Delegating $pls tokens to validator/s of your choice.<br /><br />2nd. Interacting with PulseSwap, a fork of pancake swap that Richard Heart is working on with the dev team. (eHex and pHex liquidity pools)<br /><br />3rd. Parallel behaviour on both chains. (Ethereum and Pulsechain)<br /><br />These are the three legs to the strategy at the main net launch. Maximising profits while working in tandem between the two chains.<br />PulseChain has not launched yet.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gitlab.com/pulsechaincom">https://gitlab.com/pulsechaincom</a><br /><br />Check out the Testnet Pulse token Faucet<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://faucet.testnet.pulsechain.com/">https://faucet.testnet.pulsechain.com/</a><br /><br />Try to delegate stake on the Pulsechain Testnet<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://stake.testnet.pulsechain.com/">https://stake.testnet.pulsechain.com/</a><br /><br />#HEX #PULSECHAIN #CRYPTO<br />*DISCLAIMER*<br />We are not a financial advisors, these videos, the topics discussed, and the ideas presented are opinions and presented for entertainment purposes only. <br />We urge everyone to do their own research before participating in anything that requires time/money.
