I held you close as you cried. It’s always a little damp here after the rain ‘cause it seeps in the cracks in the window frame. Our first place in Columbus–apartment twenty-one–with the dirty, dingy carpet, with the beige-colored tub. But I feel like myself here laying with you. I think that you know what we gotta do. We don’t need your congratulations. What we got is a big, bright ball of light. We don’t need anyone’s permission. I’m gonna love you ‘til the day that I die. I’m gonna love you ‘til the day that I die. In a room with your parents, we escape to the beach, and my heart breaks for the millionth time when your mom starts to scream. Someday, it’ll just be me and you–we could sit here as long as we wanted to. In an office building downtown, on a backdrop made for pets, we got married with our friends around. Still took our photos on the courthouse steps to let them know they couldn’t stop us if they tried. I kissed you under the pale Ohio sky. A little house in Carolina, in a cool autumn breeze, watching the sunset from a hammock, our names carved into the tree, I’m thinking of the steps that brought us here–how there’s no way I finish without you, dear.<br /><br />Find Dan Campbell here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://dancampbell.co/">https://dancampbell.co/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/broompeople/">https://www.instagram.com/broompeople/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/headabovewater">https://twitter.com/headabovewater</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/dancampbell.co/">https://www.facebook.com/dancampbell.co/</a>{% endraw %}
