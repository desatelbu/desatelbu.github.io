{% raw %}This is such a fantastic song! I happened to stumble across it while searching for the song &quot;Captivate Us&quot; by Christy Nockels (another fantastic song, by the way). This group is based in Jakarta, Indonesia, and the lead singer is Sidney Mohede, who also wrote the song. I can't stop listening to this song! What an awesome testament of love to our Creator and Savior!{% endraw %}
