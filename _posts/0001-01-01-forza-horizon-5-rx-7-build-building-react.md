{% raw %}Building 'React team' inspired RX-7 in the preview build of Forza Horizon 5.<br />As mentioned in the video every game restart will reset your progress and we will not be able to keep our liveries, that's why the livery is kinda rushed. Besides that, I'm really happy with the new design editor UI and increased decal resolution on cars is a welcome change as well.<br />The build was running on Xbox Series X in 4k 30fps quality mode (video is 60fps because of sped-up parts).<br /><br />Huge thanks to Forza for this opportunity! <br /><br />STICKERS / SCREENSHOTS <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.crownedstore.com/">https://www.crownedstore.com/</a> <br />SUPPORT WITH PATREON <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/CROWNED">https://www.patreon.com/CROWNED</a><br />ALL LINKS <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.crownedstore.com/contacts">https://www.crownedstore.com/contacts</a> #crowned<br /><br />Not an ingame music.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/L-mUOqSHR30">https://youtu.be/L-mUOqSHR30</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/distantflows/tv-on-the-radio-wolf-like-me-distant-flows-remix">https://soundcloud.com/distantflows/tv-on-the-radio-wolf-like-me-distant-flows-remix</a>{% endraw %}
