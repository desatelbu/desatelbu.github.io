I'm Emma, and I'm 16. Have you watched the &quot;The Squid Game&quot; dorama? I bet you do! Thanks to that, I have become the most popular girl in school. But to do that, I had to join the crazy game and pass the same tests as the characters of the series. Our game had it all - soldiers, shooting, Marbles, betrayals, massacre... Ahaha, I'm kidding! No massacre… However, you have to watch it yourself.{% endraw %}
