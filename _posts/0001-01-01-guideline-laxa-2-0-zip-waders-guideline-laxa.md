{% raw %}Guideline Laxa 2.0 ZIP waders have the most important features, while still offering best possible value for the money.  They are manufactured from a strong, 4-layer Nylon fabric with a 20.000 mm water resistant and 5000g/m2/24hrs moisture transporting membrane. An environmentally friendly PFOA free DWR surface treatment repels both dirt and water from the outshell. Inseams on the waders are eliminated by our Sidewinder™ design, which also gives good articulation and a comfortable fit.<br /><br />The waterproof TIZIP® Master Seal front zipper offers maximum flexibility and strength, and makes it easy to get in and out of your waders. Positioned high on the chest are two large chest pockets with vertical zippers and mesh fronts. Behind you find fleece lined roomy hand warmer pockets for those chilly days.<br /><br /> • Adjustable suspenders, rear belt loop with dual heights.<br /> • Elastic adjustable wader belt with quick release buckle ensure good fit.<br /> • Lower legs have strong heavy fabric gravel guards with rubber reinforce stretch cuffs.<br /> • Custom cut high-density neoprene socks have a great fit and left/right shape for extra comfort.<br /> • Laxa waders come in 11 different sizes from XS- XXXL.<br /> • Color: Graphite gray with matching grey suspenders, belt and socks.<br /> • TIZIP® Master Seal zipper.<br /><br />The Guideline Laxa 2.0 ZIP Wader can be purchased via all Guideline ProShops:<br /><br />EU - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.guidelineflyfish.com/proshops">https://www.guidelineflyfish.com/proshops</a><br />SE - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.guidelineflyfish.se/proshops">https://www.guidelineflyfish.se/proshops</a><br />NO - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.guideline.no/proshops">https://www.guideline.no/proshops</a>{% endraw %}
