{% raw %}Dave Rubin of The Rubin Report talks to Paul Rossi, a whistleblower and math teacher at Grace Church School, about the NYC private school’s critical race theory influenced antiracism curriculum that led him to publish “I Refuse to Stand By While My Students Are Indoctrinated” on the Substack of Bari Weiss. In this clip Paul reveals the damage being done by critical race theory being forced onto young kids. Paul describes how critical race theory in education had been building slowly for years. Recently he had noticed the damaging effects it was having on his students by making them feel like they couldn’t have opinions that differed from the social justice orthodoxy. Young kids were made to feel guilt and shame over their alleged “white privilege”. He also describes the incident that made him decide to speak up and put his job at risk.<br /><br />Watch Dave Rubin’s FULL INTERVIEW with PAUL ROSSI here: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZdddZYKFpU&amp;list=PLEbhOtC9klbBQiqrd9ZZThHpEmsH1oL_H&amp;index=1">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZdddZYKFpU&amp;list=PLEbhOtC9klbBQiqrd9ZZThHpEmsH1oL_H&amp;index=1</a><br /><br />Want to have a glimpse of some of the research and ideas that are emerging from universities and are about to enter the mainstream and shape our culture?
