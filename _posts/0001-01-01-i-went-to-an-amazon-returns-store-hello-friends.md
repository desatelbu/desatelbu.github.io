{% raw %}HELLO FRIENDS!! This week, I ventured to an Amazon Liquidation Store in Raleigh, NC called Treasure Hunt Liquidators to get me a haul of Amazon customer returns! A few years ago, we bought an Amazon Return Box from a liquidation website -- and it was kind of crazy, but we *were* able to get a lot of stuff for a pretty big discount. So when I heard about an Amazon Returns Store... I figured we had to go! I got a drone, a spice blender, a go pro lens, a massage chair, and a microdermabrasion tool (and a lava lamp &amp; succulent growth light) -- all for $10 each!<br /><br />You can check out Treasure Hunt Liquidators here!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/treasurehuntliquidators/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/treasurehuntliquidators/?hl=en</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://treasure-hunt-liquidators.shoplightspeed.com/">https://treasure-hunt-liquidators.shoplightspeed.com/</a><br /><br />Quick note -- the in-store shopping segments were filmed in late July/early August, when the mask mandate in NC was lifted -- which is why you see a mix of mask &amp; no-mask! We decided to wear a mask while shopping just because it was kind of close quarters in the store, but it was optional at that time.<br /><br />This video is NOT sponsored!!<br /><br />My Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/​">https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/​</a><br />My TikTok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany?">https://www.tiktok.com/@safiyany?</a><br />Our new livestreaming channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/safiyatyler">https://www.youtube.com/safiyatyler</a><br />Our new YouTube Shorts channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLKQoTgt5BwFJJKWyeXHbig">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLKQoTgt5BwFJJKWyeXHbig</a><br /><br />MUSIC<br />Via AudioNetwork<br /><br />PRODUCED &amp; EDITED by<br />Safiya Nygaard<br />Tyler Williams<br />Madi Price<br /><br />GFX by Dayana Espinoza{% endraw %}
