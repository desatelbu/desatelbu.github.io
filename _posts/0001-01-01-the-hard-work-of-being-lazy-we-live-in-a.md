{% raw %}We live in a culture that hugely values activity and 'hard work'. But - paradoxically - the hardest work we can sometimes do is to stop rushing around and, for once, sit with our thoughts, analyse our feelings, take stock of where we are and understand ourselves better. From the outside, it might look as though we're being lazy.

We’re simply not able to write anything new or can’t face setting up more meetings. We don’t want to clean the fridge or go out to befriend prospective clients. All we have an appetite for, it seems, is to loll on the sofa and maybe dip randomly into a book, wander down to the shops and buy a packet of biscuits or spend an hour or so soaking in the bath. We might, at an extreme, merely want to sit by the window and stare at the clouds. For a long time.”<br /><br /><br />MORE SCHOOL OF LIFE<br /><br />Visit us in person at our London HQ: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2Zngxpk">https://bit.ly/2Zngxpk</a><br /><br />Watch more films on SELF in our playlist: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/TSOLself">http://bit.ly/TSOLself</a><br /><br />You can submit translations and transcripts on all of our videos here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/timedtext_cs_panel?c=UC7IcJI8PUf5Z3zKxnZvTBog&amp;tab=2">https://www.youtube.com/timedtext_cs_panel?c=UC7IcJI8PUf5Z3zKxnZvTBog&amp;tab=2</a> <br />Find out how more here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6054623?hl=en-GB">https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6054623?hl=en-GB</a> <br /><br /><br />SOCIAL MEDIA<br /><br />Feel free to follow us at the links below:<br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/theschooloflifelondon/">https://www.facebook.com/theschooloflifelondon/</a>  <br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/TheSchoolOfLife">https://twitter.com/TheSchoolOfLife</a>   <br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/">https://www.instagram.com/theschooloflifelondon/</a> <br /><br /><br />CREDITS<br /><br />Produced in collaboration with:<br /><br />Andrei Verioti<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://verioti.co/">http://verioti.co/</a> <br /><br /><br />Title animation produced in collaboration with<br /><br />Vale Productions<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.valeproductions.co.uk/">https://www.valeproductions.co.uk/</a>{% endraw %}
