{% raw %}We met a refugee from Baku in Patara/Ptretsik (Armenian: Պատարա/Պտրեցիկ), a village in Askeran, Artsakh, which is home to many wild horses. He escaped pogroms with his children, was attacked on the train to Russia, saved by his friend, and arrived in Armenia. A few days later the whole country witnessed the 1988 Spitak earthquake that killed 50 000 Armenians and injured 130 000. After moving to Artsakh where he was born, the war broke out in 1991, shortly after the collapse of the Soviet Union. He recalls the horrors of the first Karabakh war, how all of NKR was in a blockade with no supplies, destined to be completely annihilated and miraculously saved. Now after the recent war he can't imagine coexistence and says that 100 years must pass till we can live without peacekeepers. <br />Another resident recalls how her grandson came running and told her that the war began and how the young women started leaving with the village with children, men were on the frontlines and only the elderly remained. The shelling of the civilian infrastructure kept going and they were being urged to leave too, but they were mourning the death of their grandson and refused. Eventually, they were evacuated. After the war when Aliyev came to Shushi and they shot fireworks from there, everyone thought that they started shelling Armenians around Shushi, as they did in the 90s. The woman tells us about the PTSD everyone is suffering from, especially children, and how they get scared at every loud noise. She also recalls coexistence during the Soviet times and remembers a family friend, Savet, a young Azeri man, who was like a family member to them. Now she can't imagine how coexistence is possible after having witnessed the horrors of another war. <br />Yet, both while finding it difficult to imagine coexistence, agree on and want only one thang — peace, saying &quot;There is nothing better than peace, nothing more important than peace.&quot;<br />_______<br />Donate here to help fund our work: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gofund.me/1e0c9651">https://gofund.me/1e0c9651</a><br />&quot;The Desire To Live&quot; is a documentary made in Artsakh by creators from Artsakh.
