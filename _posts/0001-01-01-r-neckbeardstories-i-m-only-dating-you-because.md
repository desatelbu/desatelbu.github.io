{% raw %}In this episode of r/NeckbeardStories we listen to OP complain about her failed relationship for almost an hour. I don't think this guy fully qualifies as a neckbeard tbh... He and OP are both guilty for this trainwreck of a relationship and I hafta call it as I see it...<br /><br />It doesn't matter what your background is, you always need to treat people like people and not use them simply to get off. Neckbeards seem to learn this lesson particularly slow and it really does make my blood boil... So we must bring it to light so others don't suffer alone.<br /><br />For your fill of neckbeard stories we've got you covered with the freshest weeaboo, niceguy, and neckbeard happenings on reddit. Stick with ReddX for your daily dose of cringe with a side-dish of relatability. You might even feel good for dessert... But who can say?<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />#reddit #neckbeard #mewtwo<br /><br />Join me on Discord dude: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/Sju7YckUWu">https://discord.gg/Sju7YckUWu</a><br /><br />One-time PayPal donation: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.me/daytondoes">https://www.paypal.me/daytondoes</a><br /><br />Support this channel on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://patreon.com/daytondoes">http://patreon.com/daytondoes</a><br /><br />Stalk me on the Twitter! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/daytondoes">http://www.twitter.com/daytondoes</a><br /><br />Visit me over on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/ReddXD/">https://www.facebook.com/ReddXD/</a><br /><br />Got a story?

They are frustrating to deal with, but luckily you aren't alone! These r/neckbeardstories from Reddit are among the top posts of all time and include some of the funniest Reddit stories ever posted on the neckbeard stories subreddit! rSlash NeckbeardStories have all kinds of funny neckbeards in them, but especially the nice guy. And the weeaboo. There is a wide spectrum of neckbeards, and this is but a small slice of it.<br /><br />Listening to ReddX's neckbeard stories playlist is a great experience! These neckbeard stories Top Posts of All Time from Reddit are made for you to enjoy any time you feel like it, so be sure to save my rSlash neckbeard stories playlist to your favorites! <br /><br />While there are many rslash channels that read r/neckbeard stories and r/prorevenge from reddit, each channel has their own way of performing them.<br /><br />Some of the top rSlash entitled parents channels I recommend checking out are the original rSlash, Redditor, fresh, r/Bumfries, VoiceyHere, Mr Reddit, Storytime and Darkfluff. These Reddit story channels inspired me to start my own Reddit story channel, with a focus on Entitled Parents stories and at times going into the r/pettyrevenge and r/choosingbeggars subreddit as well.<br /><br />Because most of my audience prefers Entitled Parents stories of Reddit, I tend to just stick with reading the r/EntitleParents Top Posts of All Time. But I also enjoy getting up close and personal with neckbeards and weeaboos from time to time.<br /><br />Subscribe to ReddX for the freshest daily Reddit content. I post relatable readings of Reddit posts and Reddit stories every single day! Journey with me as I relate these amazing Reddit stories to my personal life journey.
