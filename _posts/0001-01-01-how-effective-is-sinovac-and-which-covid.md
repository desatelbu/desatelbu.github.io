{% raw %}The CoronaVac vaccine against Covid-19, produced by Chinese pharmaceutical firm SinoVac, has been approved for use in 39 countries around the world—with more than 1 billion doses distributed globally already. <br /><br />Today, I’ll take you through the scientific literature to give you everything you need to know about SinoVac’s effectiveness.<br /><br />Specifically, I’ll tell you what is known about:<br /><br />How effective SinoVac is at preventing infection, hospitalization, and death?<br />How does the effectiveness changes against variants, such as gamma or delta?<br />How quickly does immunity wane after vaccination? <br />How does SinoVac compare to other Covid vaccines?<br /><br />As a bonus, we’ll look at a study that actually ranks vaccines for their effectiveness, according to neutralizing antibody levels.<br /><br />0:00 Introduction<br />0:48 How is Vaccine Effectiveness Measured?<br />3:15 How Effective is Sinovac?<br />5:48 How do Variants Impact Effectiveness?<br />8:05 How does Immunity Wane over Time?<br />9:37 Which Vaccine is the Best?<br />10:39 What does this mean?<br /><br />Always remember that this review of scientific literature is not meant to provide medical guidance to individuals.
