{% raw %}Lara Croft is the fiercely independent daughter of an eccentric adventurer, lost to her when she was barely a teen.  Now 21 and struggling to make her way in the world, Lara is determined to forge her own path rather than take the reins of her father's global empire...so even she can't understand what drives her to solve the puzzle of his mysterious death.  Going explicitly against her dad's final wishes, Lara leaves the familiar streets of London in search of a mythical island -- which may or may not exist -- somewhere off the coast of Hong Kong.  With her life threatened at every turn and with no training or experience to fall back on, Lara's sharp mind, blind faith and inherently stubborn spirit are the only weapons sheâ€™ll have on this non-stop, action-packed, trial-by-fire adventure into the unknown.{% endraw %}
