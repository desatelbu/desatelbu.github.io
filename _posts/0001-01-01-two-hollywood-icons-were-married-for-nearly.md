{% raw %}#DanielsAndBartlett #WilliamDaniels #BonnieBartlett <br />Remember George Feeny and Lily Bolander from Boy Meets World? They were married in real life! Actors William Daniels and Bonnie Bartlett have been husband and wife for almost seven decades – imagine that – but they maintain low-key enough profiles that many people don’t even know.<br />-----------------------------------------------------------<br />In this video, images are used that do not belong to me.
