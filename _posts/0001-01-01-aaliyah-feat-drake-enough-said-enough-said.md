Drake (Official Audio)<br /><br />Produced by 40<br /><br />Lyrics: <br /><br />I can tell there's something wrong witchu<br />Tell me do you wanna talk about it<br />You say you got a lot on your mind<br />Sit down, let's talk about it<br />I hate to see you feel this way<br />So tell me, what can I do to make<br />It better for you, make it better for you, baby<br /><br />Yeah<br />Yeah<br />Yeah<br />Yeah<br /><br />Baby, tell me what I gotta do to get you to talk about it<br />Cause we've been together a little too long for you not to talk about it<br />So tell me what you would like me to do<br />To help you, help me, help you<br />Cause I don't really want to tell without you<br />Tell me why<br /><br />Went from my nigga serving it by the tele to venues in Manchester<br />Just swerving with Balotelli the fuck are you trying to tell me<br />Bothers me when you got to play therapist<br />That shit's embarrassing<br />They even bring up these niggas make a comparison<br />They just got to forgive me, this watch is a 150<br />Still ain't got the time for a bitch to be acting iffy<br />Running through the city with niggas I'd give a kidney<br />Selling under 150 you niggas got to be kidding<br />Is this even still a discussion?<br />Don't you ever wake up disgusted<br />Every million I gain an enemy or a cousin<br />And people's feelings have changed ever since I became something<br />Girls that becoming ladies, and my friends are having babies<br />And babies are dropping dead in my city, this shit is crazy<br />And I don't know if speaking on it helps<br />This is shit that's on my mind I just keep it to myself<br />You know<br /><br />Can't you talk to me<br />Let's talk about it, talk about it<br />Tell me what you need<br />Just tell me baby, tell me baby<br />Sometimes you are, all alone<br />But there's no doubt<br />So don't just shut me out<br />Cause that's not what love's about<br /><br />Came too far to give up, gotta try<br />Cause I can't do it on my own<br />--<br /><br />(C) 2012 Blackground Records{% endraw %}
