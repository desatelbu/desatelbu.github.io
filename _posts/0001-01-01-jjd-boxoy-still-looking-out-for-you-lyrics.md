Eline Esmee<br /><br />We were together night and day<br />But you moved away<br />Had to go our separate ways<br /><br />All the streets feel empty now<br />When I drive downtown<br />But you’re never around<br /><br />If you ever pass me by <br />Would you stop and look behind<br />Or would you ignore me?<br />Or talk before we go?<br /><br />Can I look you in the eye<br />Even if it's one more time<br />Cuz’ after all these years, oh<br />I’m still looking out for you<br /><br />I’m still looking out for you<br /><br />Time caught up with us <br />Because the world was at our feet<br />It left us bittersweet, but<br />Never found someone else i could trust <br />Never felt so secure<br />Like the day i was yours, no, no <br /><br />If you ever pass me by <br />Would you stop and look behind<br />Or would you ignore me?<br />Or talk before we go?<br /><br />Can I look you in the eye<br />Even if it's one more time<br />Cuz’ after all these years, oh<br />I’m still looking out for you<br /><br />Ha, ah<br />Oh, I’m still looking out for you 2x<br /><br />I’m still looking out for you<br />I’m still looking out for you, no, no, no<br />I’m still looking out for you, no, no, no<br /><br />Bittersweet taste <br />Wonder where you’ve been these days<br />Do I still recognise your face?<br /><br />Bittersweet taste<br />Longing for your embrace<br />My arms wrapped around your wait<br /><br />I’m still looking out for you<br />I’m still looking out for you<br />I’m still looking out for you, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah<br /><br />I’m still looking out for you<br /><br />.........<br />📧Contacto: hellosundaymnc@gmail.com<br />.........<br /><br />#JJD #BOXOY #StillLookingOutForYou #Lyrics #ElineEsmee #7cloudsRelease{% endraw %}
