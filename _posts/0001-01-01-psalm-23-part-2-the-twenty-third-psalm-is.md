{% raw %}The twenty-third psalm is one of the most famous–if not the most famous–passages of scripture in all the Bible.  Unfortunately, though it is widely known, it's almost always associated with funerals.  Not that that's a bad thing in and of itself.  I myself almost always read it at funerals.  The problem is, it gets associated more with death than it does with life.  This is unfortunate as it is one of the highest expressions of what life in the Kingdom of God can be.<br /><br />In last week's episode of The Pursuit of Love Podcast, we drilled down on that opening phrase, &quot;The Lord is my shepherd.&quot;  In today's episode, we look at the rest of the rich imagery David used in this beloved psalm and how it helps us to conceptualize life in God's ever-present kingdom.{% endraw %}
