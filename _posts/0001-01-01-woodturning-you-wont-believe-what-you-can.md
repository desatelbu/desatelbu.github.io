{% raw %}I wanted to try this finishing technique, so I found a piece of firewood that looked like it would have some interesting grain and got turning. Unfortunately the grain wasn't as nice as I thought it would be and as it was my first time trying this finish the gold didn't standout as much as I wanted it to. <br />Still, I am really pleased with the results as it reminds me of a worn draught pump handle, especially because of the small exposed ring of wood at the top. Weirdly this is one of those pieces I really love because of its imperfections.... even the natural crack in the Ash that took in some of the gold, and the two larger cracks at the bottom, it all adds to the character of the piece.  <br /><br />I will be trying this finish again soon, hopefully with a bolder result. <br /><br />Let me know what you think üòÅ<br />________________________________________________________________<br />Hope you enjoy/enjoyed, please consider liking and subscribing, even give the video a share if you're up for it! Each project and video usually takes 10+ hours to finish, so your support is very much appreciated. More woodturning and woodworking projects will be on their way soon.<br /><br />Instagram: harrysmith_woodturning<br />TikTok: @harrysmithwoodturning<br />Email for quotes and queries: harrysmithwoodturning@gmail.com<br /><br />Disclaimer:<br />My videos are for entertainment purposes only. I am still relatively new to woodturning and some of my techniques might not be the &quot;best&quot; or safest. When using any tools or machinery always read and understand safety/manufacturers guidelines.<br />Yes, I'm aware that wearing gloves while woodturning is considered an unsafe practise. The gloves I wear are tight fitting and don‚Äôt have any loose threads.  I wear them for the protection of my skin. This is a risk that I am willing to take, however I am still very conscious of the potential danger and I do not touch any spinning parts of the lathe. DO NOT do anything you don‚Äôt feel comfortable doing.{% endraw %}
