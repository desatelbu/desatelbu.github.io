{% raw %}Digital Playback is a marketing attribution platform that maximises return on investment by highlighting when an individual is in market, and which channel will be most effective in converting your live opportunities. <br />-------<br />Having the confidence to adjust, reallocate or drop marketing investment for specific channels in the media mix can often be difficult for marketers, particularly when hard evidence of customer profitability and channel and campaign performance is lacking.<br /><br />Imagine spending £thousands on Paid Search only to find out later that those individuals would have come to you anyway via another channel <br /><br />Ideally you would be able to demonstrate the profitability of marketing spend and business growth delivered by targeting the right individual, at the right time, with the right message using the right channel.<br /><br />Digital Playback:<br /><br />• Chronologically clusters all interactions a known or unknown individual makes across all channels and devices to highlight the role of each media channel in the sale.<br /><br />• Segments individuals based on engagement, value bands and channel preference to give a true measurement of incremental performance and to deploy more responsive real-time or planned campaigns.<br /><br />With this new understanding of the whole customer journey you can build more effective marketing campaigns by investing in the activity that is truly working.  If your annual budget is £1million on Paid Search you could typically save £150k immediately.   <br /><br />Contact us at info@goinspire.co.uk or visit www.goinspire.co.uk/contact for more information.{% endraw %}
