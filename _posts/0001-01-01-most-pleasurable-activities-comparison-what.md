{% raw %}Everybody likes to feel good. But there are many different kinds of pleasures, and people experience pleasures in different ways. Some things in life fill us with joy even though they are such small, simple things. They provide moments of pure magic that bring us firmly back into the present moment and make us grateful for everything we have in life. Here are some of the things that give humans the greatest pleasure.<br /><br />There are some things in life that make you feel content and happy that are easier to come by and often more meaningful because of their simplicity.  You don't have to win the lottery and become instantly wealthy or even gain a small financial windfall like $100 to enjoy some pleasures in life. <br /><br />We may fantasize about going on a tropical vacation, buying a luxury car, or winning the lottery, but there's good news for those of us who aren't likely to fulfill those dreams anytime soon: We don't actually need any of that fancy stuff to find pleasure.<br /><br />Some pleasurable activities are almost always free of charge. Sipping morning coffee, enjoying the peace and quiet before the crazy day begins can be one of the best pleasures ever. Getting a (free) library book and reading a novel that can change your life costs exactly nothing (other than your time).<br /><br />On some of your hectic days, it’s so dang hard to stop and take a breath, much less reflect on how you are really feeling. There are always activities you can do to amp up your good vibes. Consider trying a few of these - or all of them! <br /><br />SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL —► - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2YxSZw1">https://bit.ly/2YxSZw1</a><br /><br />Let us know in the comments below if there's a video you'd like to see!<br /><br />The data and statistics videos are based on internet searches, online community discussions and online articles.
