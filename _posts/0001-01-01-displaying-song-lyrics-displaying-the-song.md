{% raw %}Displaying the song lyrics during worship is a great way to increase participation during the service, especially when people are not physically together. So you wanted to know - &quot;Can we show the song lyrics when we stream our worship service?&quot; <br /><br /> <br /><br />Yes. Your stream can have lyrics embedded in the stream itself or it can show lyrics in the background (for example, behind a song leader). Song Select makes this even easier with access to lyrics for songs covered by your CCLI Church Copyright License. <br /><br /> <br /><br /><br />Just make sure to incorporate artist acknowledgements or writer credits for all songs used, and include following each song performed or at the end of the worship service. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Still have questions?
