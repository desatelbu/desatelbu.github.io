{% raw %}View from Montagna La Laguna. There are 2 big hills next to the ocean in Los Llanos municipality.  They seem to be from some ancient  volcanic eruption. I got to the top of one of them. My intention was to fly drone from there. However I encountered civil guards right on top of that montagna and they turned me away from there. 13.10.21.<br /><br />#CumbreVieja #LaPalma #LaLaguna{% endraw %}
