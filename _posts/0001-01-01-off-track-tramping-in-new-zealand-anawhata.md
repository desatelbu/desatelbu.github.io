{% raw %}We did a massive (for us) hike of 11 km from Northern Piha to Anawhata. It was incredible and exhausting! We crossed over beach, through bush, tide pools, big waves, more bush, and country roads. <br /><br />It was a combination of tracks from North Piha - Laird Thompson - Whites Beach - Anawhata Beach - Anawhata Beach track - White Track - North Piha. GO AT LOW TIDE!<br /><br />Inspiration for the hike came from - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://nztramper.com/north-piha-to-anawhata-coast-track/">https://nztramper.com/north-piha-to-anawhata-coast-track/</a><br /><br />Next time we would take the Rose track back to North Piha. <br /><br />We went a bit off track and had a lot of fun tramping through the bush and hiking with a baby. <br /><br />Anyways, thanks for watching! <br /><br />WATCH NEXT:<br />•Day trips out of Auckland - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/qNObgOW2zEA">https://youtu.be/qNObgOW2zEA</a><br />•Differences Between US and NZ - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/uePBO9o0WcE">https://youtu.be/uePBO9o0WcE</a><br />•US and NZ Food Differences - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/sjqjx1aUFGk">https://youtu.be/sjqjx1aUFGk</a><br />•Moving to NZ - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/x5PL8mLFzyI">https://youtu.be/x5PL8mLFzyI</a><br />•Whangarei Heads - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/5oPlIpCHS9E">https://youtu.be/5oPlIpCHS9E</a><br /><br />CONTACT:<br />becca.a.loveless@gmail.com<br /><br />FOLLOW ME ON INSTAGRAM - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/becca.loveless/">https://www.instagram.com/becca.loveless/</a><br /><br /><br />Moving to New Zealand <br />New Zealand<br />New Zealand Travel Vlog<br />New Zealand Beaches<br />New Zealand Bush<br />New Zealand Tramping <br />North Island New Zealand<br />New Zealand Vlogger<br />New Zealand Vlog{% endraw %}
