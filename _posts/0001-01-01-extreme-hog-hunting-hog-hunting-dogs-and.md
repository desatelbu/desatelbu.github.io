{% raw %}Xtreme hog hunter Randy Brown is frequently asked questions about the dogs he uses on his hog hunts. Each dog of his is specially trained for their individual hunting tasks, whether it be tracking a hog or holding it down. In this week's episode of Team Wild's Xtreme Hoggers, Randy introduces you to the Enon Plantation's hog hunting dogs, and shows you the kit that they use to track them when they're baying those problem porkers.{% endraw %}
