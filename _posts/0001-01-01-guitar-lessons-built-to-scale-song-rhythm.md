{% raw %}Graphic design is my passion, what with that thumbnail and all.<br /><br />Another month, another animation. Still no Fireworks, but we'll get there at some point, hopefully. For now, here's one of my favourites. Sidetracked me for a variety of reasons, though I'd like to give special thanks to Kievit for showing me some cool stuff regarding SFX and unintentionally throwing me towards this instead of Rockers 2 as a result. We've made some pretty significant breakthroughs with the Guitar Lessons sounds, I think.<br /><br />Rockers was a tricky one. Aside from the inherent difficulties in recreating a DS game, I was also creating a work with existing, well, &quot;competition&quot;. A few takes on this game have already been made, so my focus was more on making my own interpretation unique while still functional. It's most visible in the character designs, but I'm also quite happy with the layout and proportions. Some nice, broad camera sweeps, though sometimes it feels like the text boxes are taking a bit too much space.<br /><br />The last section is, of course, a reference to Built to Scale (DS). Felt like spicing it up a little (a bit of showing off can't hurt much). Apologies for mild(?) flashing lights though.<br /><br /> ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ <br /><br />Game: Rhythm Heaven (DS)<br />Rhythm Game: Guitar Lessons (Built to Scale Song)<br />Original Developers: Nintendo SPD, TNX Music Recordings<br />Original Publisher: Nintendo<br /><br />Illustration, Animation, Video: GENERIC<br />Sound Effects: GENERIC, Kievit<br />Built to Scale &quot;Tutorial&quot; Music: GENERIC<br /><br />My Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/GENERIC_wav">https://twitter.com/GENERIC_wav</a>{% endraw %}
