{% raw %}Welcome to Harry Potter Theory. Today discussing the Goblet of Fire, Harry Potter, and the Triwizard tournament. More specifically, we’re going to be discussing something that I’m sure has crossed the minds of Harry Potter fans at one point or another - WHAT HAPPENS if you REFUSE to participate in the fabled Triwizard tournament?<br /><br />The triwizard tournament is a contest like no other- an event dating back more than 700 years that tests the intelligence, courage, and strength of those participating. Since its inception, the contest has gone forward every 5 years- with a BRIEF 200 year pause due to all three champions being injured in 1792. Per Pottermore:<br /><br />“The Triwizard Tournament was first established some seven hundred years ago as a friendly competition between the three largest European schools of wizardry: Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang. A champion was selected to represent each school, and the three champions competed in three magical tasks. The schools took it in turns to host the tournament once every five years, and it was generally agreed to be a most excellent way of establishing ties between young witches and wizards of different nationalities — until, that is, the death toll mounted so high that the tournament was discontinued.&quot;<br /><br />3 schools, 3 champions and 3 challenges are the rationale for the tournament’s name- with ‘tri’ referencing ‘three’. And for years, the tournament stayed true to this figure of ‘3’. However, in Harry’s year, in typical Harry fashion, he (unintentionally) broke this mould and made it more of a ‘quad-wizard tournament’. In the Goblet of Fire, 4 wizards were competing for eternal glory, 1000 galleons, and of course the famed and revered ‘triwizard cup’.<br /><br />Breaking hundreds of years of tradition, Harry inadvertently became an extra participant, being thrown in to the mix with Viktor Krum, Cedric Diggory, and Fleur Delacour. But my question is- what sort of ramifications did this carry? The whole tournament was created by powerful wizards and witches of times past- so, I can’t help but wonder what kind of powerful magic was in place to ensure that the tournament remained on course- staying true to its original nature.<br /><br />...Watch the video for the rest!<br /><br /><br />MYTHOLOGY CHANNEL<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMNO5DyuBpWRlWwTjqaP6RQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMNO5DyuBpWRlWwTjqaP6RQ</a><br /><br />Join this channel to get access to perks:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVqoigIqNacy9xMnEDZzN_Q/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVqoigIqNacy9xMnEDZzN_Q/join</a><br /><br />Please LIKE / SUBSCRIBE / SHARE to support the channel<br /><br />Leave your video ideas down below!<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/hptheory/">https://www.instagram.com/hptheory/</a><br /><br />Tok - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@harry_potter_theory">https://www.tiktok.com/@harry_potter_theory</a><br /><br />All content falls under fair use: any copying of copyrighted material done for a limited and “transformative” purpose, such as to comment upon, criticize, or parody a copyrighted work.
