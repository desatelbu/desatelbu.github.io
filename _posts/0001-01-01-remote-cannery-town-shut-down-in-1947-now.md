{% raw %}Through all of my adventures on the Pacific Ocean departing from Bella Coola, not once have I passed this. cannery without admiring and wondering of its history.  Today, I finally got my chance to go over and do some exploring and interview the current owner of the property.  <br />This is the Tallheo Cannery, and its history stretches back more than 100 years.  It is pretty remarkable walking around this property and seeing all of the old historic buildings, but the coast of BC, used to littered with operations much like this one.  Unfortunately, changes in world markets and our turbulent BC coast weather, has brought an end to all of these old operations, often leaving no trace of their existence.  We are lucky to have several left along our coast, but the upkeep is a constant battle.  <br />I feel fortunate to have had the opportunity to cover this story and see this property, as there is so much to see.  The buildings left are in great shape, but what is historical and original, is maintained only to a necessary level, keeping it as original as possible.  The loft in the cannery building still has nets hanging from the rafters, having not moved for decades.  The general store still has items on the shelves, and the office has books sitting open on the desk as if they had just left yesterday.<br />I knew I would enjoy this location, but it far surpassed my expectations, and I hope you all enjoy it as well. <br /><br />If you want to see places like this, youre going to need a great adventure boat to get there, and I have just the boat for you ;)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://swellfish.co/?rfsn=5864361.306c0b&amp;utm_source=refersion&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=5864361.306c0b">https://swellfish.co/?rfsn=5864361.306c0b&amp;utm_source=refersion&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=5864361.306c0b</a><br /><br />If you enjoy this channel, please consider supporting on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/DestinationAdventure">https://www.patreon.com/DestinationAdventure</a>{% endraw %}
