All animals need food to live. Predator animals need the flesh of the animals that they kill to survive. Weasels, hawks, wolves, mountain lions, and grizzly bears are all predators. Predators are carnivores, which means their diet consists of meat. Some predators, such as coyotes and bears, are also scavengers, meaning they will eat the carcasses of animals that they didn't hunt themselves.<br /><br />Thumbnail from: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC19O8xKziMfuWsHw2K-E6cA/videos">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC19O8xKziMfuWsHw2K-E6cA/videos</a><br /><br />‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨<br />‚ô´Music Used‚ô´<br />Track: T-Mass - Ignoring My Heart [NCS Release]<br />Music provided by NoCopyrightSounds.<br />Watch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/eT0tYnWX2sQ">https://youtu.be/eT0tYnWX2sQ</a><br />Free Download / Stream: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://ncs.io/ignoringmyheartYO">http://ncs.io/ignoringmyheartYO</a><br /><br />Song: MusicbyAden - Summer Love<br />Music provided by Vlog No Copyright Music.<br />Creative Commons - Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported<br />Video Link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/bSW9_CNI4_w">https://youtu.be/bSW9_CNI4_w</a><br /><br />Song: Vlad Gluschenko - Palm Trees<br />Music provided by Vlog No Copyright Music.<br />Creative Commons - Attribution 3.0 Unported<br />Video Link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/qeUgJQPaKTA">https://youtu.be/qeUgJQPaKTA</a><br /><br />‚ùóI may have used small parts of your video.
