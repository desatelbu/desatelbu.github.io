{% raw %}Hello everyone and thanks for tuning in to today's video. We're going to look at the weather for the next ten to fourteen days for this video. Day ten will take us to the seventh of November and we'll be able to extend out beyond that with the extended GFS and ECM ensembles (they run to around a couple of weeks) - We'll have a look at the CFS V2 for November at the end of the video!<br /><br />The weather has turned increasingly unsettled this week with a wet and windy Halloween weekend looking likely.<br /><br />Moving out to the first week to ten days of November the weather looks all set turn turn colder with a north west to south east jet stream alignment and the chance of northerly winds bringing further rain and possibly overnight frost and even some hill snow in the north...<br /><br />The cold weather is likely to be relatively short  lived as winds back into the west next week but overall November is still looking rather cold perhaps with frequent northwesterly or even northerly winds...<br /><br />‚≠ê Subscribe To GWV:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/GavsWeatherVids?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/GavsWeatherVids?sub_confirmation=1</a> ‚≠ê<br /><br />üí°  Video Credits: üí°<br /><br />CET:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadcet/cet_info_mean.html">https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadcet/cet_info_mean.html</a><br /><br />WX Maps:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.wxmaps.org/">http://www.wxmaps.org/</a><br /><br />Earthnullschool:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://earth.nullschool.net/">https://earth.nullschool.net/</a><br /><br />W-Z:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.wetterzentrale.de">http://www.wetterzentrale.de</a><br /><br />Tameteo:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tameteo.com/">https://www.tameteo.com/</a><br /><br />CFS Weeklies: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/people/mchen/CFSv2FCST/weekly/">https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/people/mchen/CFSv2FCST/weekly/</a><br /><br />üí°  GWV Links: üí°<br /><br />GWV YouTube Channel Membership:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKnPg0tFsYu03zThqgU1yTA/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKnPg0tFsYu03zThqgU1yTA/join</a><br /><br />GWV Merch Store: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gavsweathervids.creator-spring.com/">https://gavsweathervids.creator-spring.com/</a><br /><br />GWV PayPal.Me Page: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.me/GavsWeatherVids">https://www.paypal.me/GavsWeatherVids</a><br /><br />GWV Discord:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/rzPh8KJ">https://discord.gg/rzPh8KJ</a><br /><br />GWV Streamlabs:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://streamlabs.com/GavsWeatherVids/">https://streamlabs.com/GavsWeatherVids/</a><br /><br />GWV Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/GavinPartridge">https://twitter.com/GavinPartridge</a><br /><br />GWV Facebook:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/GavsWeather/">https://www.facebook.com/GavsWeather/</a><br /><br />GWV Instagram:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/gavsweathervids/">https://www.instagram.com/gavsweathervids/</a><br /><br />Ten Day Forecast: November Still Looking Rather Cold Perhaps?<br /><br />#GavsWeatherVids #WetAndWindy #Autumn2021{% endraw %}
