{% raw %}Today #NVIDIA #NVDA #Stock reported Q3 earnings. The stock gave us everything we wanted, high revenue growth, higher gross margins, low operating expenses and over 90% operating profit growth Y/Y!!! Woooo! We analyze the ARM Holding acquisition, and wonder if that fall through - could it create a buying opportunity for NVDA stock? We also go over the technicals, NVDA has been shooting straight up - we’re looking for areas of consolidation and pullbacks to buy more NVDA stock. <br /><br />— Follow Me On Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/investorvideos/">https://www.instagram.com/investorvideos/</a><br />— Follow Me On Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/investorvideos">https://twitter.com/investorvideos</a><br /><br />WANT TO HELP THE CHANNEL???
