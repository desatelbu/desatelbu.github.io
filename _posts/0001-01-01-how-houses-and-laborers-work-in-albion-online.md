{% raw %}This guide explains how houses and laborers work in Albion Online. If you ever wondered how housing works or how to get started with laborers or how to get an island then this guide is for you. Housing is very important to set up early for new and beginner players as it will greatly increase your income. Laborers are what generate a nearly passive or compound income allowing you to greatly profit from activities you are already doing.<br /><br /><br />I have other videos on my channel that cover this subject but I wanted to go in depth and make a 2021 version for new players and new subscribers who keep asking me to cover this part of Albion Online. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />If you want to give this game a try, here's the link:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://albiononline.com/?ref=35XAU9EB6D">https://albiononline.com/?ref=35XAU9EB6D</a> <br /><br /><br />üí∏Donate here:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://streamlabs.com/swolebenji">https://streamlabs.com/swolebenji</a>  (Text to speech for $1 or more.)   <br />üê¶Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/swolebenji">https://www.twitter.com/swolebenji</a>   (I don't have access till I can afford a phone.)
