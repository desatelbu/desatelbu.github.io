The clip, first shared to TikTok on October 20, purports to have been captured earlier the same day by a neighbor living across from the Laundrie family in North Port, Florida. On the morning of October 20, Roberta Laundrie and her husband Chris joined investigators on a search of Myakkahatchee Creek Park where they discovered a bag belonging to their son just 90 minutes after arriving. The miraculous discovery, which came after a five-week search by local police and the FBI, was made shortly before investigators located skeletal remains next to Brian's backpack and notebook. The Laundries were captured on video by a Fox News reporter being told by a police officer &quot;I think we found something.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />IMPORTANT! <br />-None of these images, music &amp; video clips were created/owned by us. -This video is purely fan-made, if you (owners) have seen your content and want to remove this video, please message us privately or mail us<br />emigrantionline@gmail.com<br />before doing anything.
