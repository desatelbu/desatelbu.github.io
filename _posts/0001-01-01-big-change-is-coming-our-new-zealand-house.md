{% raw %}Things in New Zealand are about to change! Travel isn't possible yet, but we've got some massive news to share... ðŸŽ¬ Learn how to make your videos incredible with our A-to-Z video editing course â€” <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://danegerandstacey.com/video-editing">https://danegerandstacey.com/video-editing</a> â¬‡ More Below â¬‡  <br /><br />Our life in New Zealand is about to change! Over 10 years ago we were able to buy a house in New Zealand as an investment property, it was my (Dane) home on and off a few times over the years in between my own travels before Stace and I met â€” then we moved in there together before our travel vlog adventures began.<br /><br />In early 2017 we decided to sell everything we own and move out of the house, before completed all the renovation ideas we had, and instead hit the road full time to travel.<br /><br />As the travel restrictions in New Zealand last longer we've decided to get back into the house, complete some renovations, design the house how we want and treat it as home. As for how long? Who knows! We want to travel and share that with you as well, but a project for now will keep us occupied and we're excited for a fun project to work on.<br /><br />New Zealand is an incredibly beautiful country with so much to offer â€” but it's a lot larger than what you'd expect! We're producing the Ultimate New Zealand Travel Guide, a hub full of Kiwi knowledge to help you on your next adventures here.
