{% raw %}Joining and leaving a UK motorway driving lesson <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.driving-school-beckenham.co.uk/motorways-joining.html">https://www.driving-school-beckenham.co.uk/motorways-joining.html</a><br /><br />This video will hopefully be useful if you're about to drive on a motorway for the first time and need some motorway tips or visiting from another country and plan on driving in the UK. A  lot of drivers have never had any motorway driving lessons.<br /><br />You're now allowed to have driving lessons in a dual-controlled car with a driving instructor on a motorway but not allowed otherwise until you pass your driving test.<br />Here is a full list of who MUST NOT use the motorway:<br />Pedestrians<br />Holders of provisional motorcycle or car licences<br />Riders of motorcycles under 50 cc, cyclists<br />Horse riders<br />Certain slow-moving vehicles and those carrying oversized loads (except by special permission)<br />Agricultural vehicles<br />Powered wheelchairs/powered mobility scooters.<br /><br />In this video we have a look at how to join a motorway. The slip road is used to adjust your speed to that of vehicles already on the motorway. Vehicles on the motorway have priority. Some drivers will change lanes to allow you to move on but don't assume they will. Stay in the left hand lane so that you can get used to the higher speed and the higher speed of others around you.<br /><br />Leaving a motorway. Look out for road signs that will show you how far away it is until you have to leave the motorway. Make sure that you're in the left hand lane in plenty of time before leaving the motorway as you don't want to cut across lanes at the last moment. If you do miss your exit then just drive on until the next one.<br /><br />This is just a rough guide to joining and leaving a motorway. We strongly recommend taking some motorway lessons with a professional driving instructor.<br /><br />☕️ Buy us a coffee <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ko-fi.com/T6T7EISN">https://ko-fi.com/T6T7EISN</a><br /><br />Overtaking on a motorway tips <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzhsfT7ysH0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzhsfT7ysH0</a><br /><br />Please subscribe for our latest videos and give us a thumbs up like if this video has helped you as it helps us to make more videos.<br /><br />If you're learning to drive then make sure that you get professional help from a fully qualified driving instructor.
