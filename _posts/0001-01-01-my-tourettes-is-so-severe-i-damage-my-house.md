{% raw %}SUBSCRIBE to Truly: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj">http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj</a><br /><br />BIANCA Saez, from Queensland, Australia has a very severe form of Tourettes Syndrome. She was diagnosed with the condition when she was five years old, when she turned 12, it became more extreme and got progressively worse. Due to her tics, Bianca breaks household items on a regular basis and has smashed countless TV screens and mirrors. With the help of her boyfriend Zac, the couple have adapted their house to accommodate Bianca’s tics. Her computer is covered in a protective plastic casing to stop Bianca from breaking it, the mirrors are made of polished stainless steel and instead of a TV, Zac and Bianca watch things on a projector. Together the pair also make a YouTube channel called B With Tourettes where Bianca documents what day to day life with the condition is like. Bianca’s dream is to raise money to start a Tourettes foundation to help other people who have also struggled with the condition. <br /><br />Follow Bianca here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/BwithTourettes">https://www.youtube.com/c/BwithTourettes</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/b_with_tourettes/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/b_with_tourettes/?hl=en</a><br /><br />Videographer: Aaron Fiora<br />Producers: Tom Jones &amp; Natalia Giorgi<br />Editor: Omar Gobere<br /><br />Truly is on TikTok! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show">https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show</a><br /><br />Now you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES">http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES</a><br /><br />Click here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! <br />Truly - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow">https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow</a><br />Born Different - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/">https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/</a><br />Shake My Beauty - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/">https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/</a><br />Hooked On The Look - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/">https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/</a><br />Love Don't Judge - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/">https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/</a><br />Beastly - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/">https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/</a><br />Ridiculous Rides - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/">https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/</a><br />Dog Dynasty - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/">https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/</a><br /><br />For more amazing content, click here!<br />Beastly: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA</a><br />Barcroft Cars: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured">https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured</a>{% endraw %}
