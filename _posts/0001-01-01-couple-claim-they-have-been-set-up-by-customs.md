{% raw %}A couple caught with three kilos of cocaine in their hand luggage claim they have been set up by Customs. In Manchester, bags belonging to a celebrity chef give massive readings for cocaine. The man eventually confesses that he's carrying cocaine in his pants.<br /><br />In Gatwick and Bristol Airports in England customs agents check baggage and travellers to uphold allowances and prevent illicit activity and substances from entering the UK. <br /><br />Content owned and licensed from Off The Fence to Little Dot Studios. <br /><br />For all questions, please contact owned-enquiries@littledotstudios.com{% endraw %}
