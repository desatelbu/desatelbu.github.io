It was the only way I could fall asleep because my brain automatically went to the worst places: what if the house burns down? what if a burglar tried to come in? I’ve carried a lot of that paranoia into my adult life, constantly feeling claustrophobic and hyper-aware of how I’m being perceived. My mind longs to have control, not only of my surroundings but of myself. I would say this song, along with Lies, are the mission statements of the album: the dark side that comes with being a perfectionist. <br /><br /><br />Written by: Will Jay, Sam Creighton<br />Produced by: Keaton Stromberg<br /><br />Every time that I try to speak<br />It feels so calculated<br />If I say what I really mean<br />It’s like you see me naked<br /><br />Not a word until I was 3<br />The doctors were elated<br />Thank god there was nothing wrong<br />And everything’s fine<br /><br />Always on the edge of my seat<br />Never the right position<br />Check the doors are locked, 1 2 3 <br />flip on and off light switches<br /><br />Something bad could happen to me<br />House will burn if I didn’t <br />Make sure that the stove was off<br />Now everything’s fine<br /><br />I need control<br />I need control<br /><br />What will I do if I lose my mind<br />Hurt someone else, or myself<br />I’m terrified <br /><br />These crazy thoughts, they won’t stop<br />Oh my<br />I feel the worst in me<br />Better tread carefully<br />I need control<br /><br />Everybody please disappear<br />I’m feeling claustrophobic<br />Way past capacity in here<br />Hard to be easygoing<br /><br />Suffocating’s my biggest fear<br />I can’t breathe in this clothing<br />Leave before something goes wrong<br />Now everything fine<br />I need control<br /><br />Make a mistake<br />I go insane<br />What can I say, I’m a perfectionist <br /><br />Slave to my brain<br />Circle the drain<br />What can I say, get me a therapist <br /><br />SOCIALS:<br />Website: www.willjaymusic.com<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/officialwilljaymusic">https://facebook.com/officialwilljaymusic</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/willjaymusic">https://instagram.com/willjaymusic</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/willjaymusic">https://twitter.com/willjaymusic</a><br />Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/user/willjaymusic">https://open.spotify.com/user/willjaymusic</a><br />Soundcloud: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/willjaymusic">https://soundcloud.com/willjaymusic</a><br /><br />WATCH MORE:<br />Popular: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtfoXDoGojDCcnPfcVPNUb9bpWWl2zBfy">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtfoXDoGojDCcnPfcVPNUb9bpWWl2zBfy</a><br />Original Music: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtfoXDoGojDCl4-NM_Wgk4Sz6WtlK4BuE">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtfoXDoGojDCl4-NM_Wgk4Sz6WtlK4BuE</a><br />Covers &amp; Mashups: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtfoXDoGojDDSl15VCwuv7mEpQuT7qzvX">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtfoXDoGojDDSl15VCwuv7mEpQuT7qzvX</a>{% endraw %}
