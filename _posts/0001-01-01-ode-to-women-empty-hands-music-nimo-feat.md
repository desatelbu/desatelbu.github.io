{% raw %}Empty Hands Music releases its first bilingual song and video with “Ode to Women”. South Asian Hip Hop Artists Nimo, Swap, and KB wrote this song aptly titled, “Ode to Women” ten years ago. A decade later they reunited along with inspiring filmmaker, Ellie Walton (www.EllieWalton.com), to bring us this powerful music video. <br /><br />Filmed in India, the country of their mother's births, this message hits close to home where women are continuing to fight for equality. This video is a breath of fresh air, especially because it's a celebration of women from the male viewpoint. Dedicated to their mothers and women all over the world.&quot;<br /><br />www.EmptyHandsMusic.org<br />www.EllieWalton.com<br /><br />Ode To Women Song Credits:<br />Written and performed by Nimesh “Nimo” Patel, Swapnil Shah, Kiran Belur<br />Beat by Harry Dixon<br />Tabla by Gurpreet Channa<br />Mixed by Lohit Pattanaik<br />Vocals recorded by David Hughes (Shine On Studios){% endraw %}
