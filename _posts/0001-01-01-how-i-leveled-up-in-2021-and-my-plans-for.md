I'm so glad you've stumbled across my channel! And if you're reading all the way down here, you're a real one. I'm an actress, dancer, pageant queen and lover of all things girly and feminine. Growing up in pageants and theatre, I've formed a love affair with etiquette and the idea of becoming a princess. I've seen Princess Diaries more times than I can count, and have read countless articles on the Royal Family. <br />Here, you'll find videos about class, grace, elegance and all things girly! I hope you enjoy and subscribe! Videos are posted every Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday!<br /><br />DISCLOSURE: This post may contain affiliate links to some of my favorite products.
