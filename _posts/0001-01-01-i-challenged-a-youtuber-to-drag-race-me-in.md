{% raw %}Drag Racing with another YouTuber in Forza Horizon 5. We build drag race cars from different categories. Some cars we races were completely stock. We even tried all drivetrain types, all wheel drive, rear wheel drive and front wheel drive. One good tip to keep in mind is you need to lower your gear ratio for more max speed. On long drag strips you gonna run out of top speed pretty fast. Hopefully you enjoyed this little drag race collaboration with @Forzarizon we did today. It was really fun to do something else besides drifting in Forza Horizon 5.<br /><br />--- Join our Discord here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/R6y34My">https://discord.gg/R6y34My</a><br /><br />--- My Twitch link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/goosiesttv">https://www.twitch.tv/goosiesttv</a><br /><br />--- My PC stats: <br />Graphics card: GeForce RTX 3070<br />Processor: Ryzen 9 (4,8GHz)<br />RAM: 16GB<br />Disc Space: 1K SSD{% endraw %}
