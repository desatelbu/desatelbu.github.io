{% raw %}#Hinduism, #SpeakersCorner, #DawahWise<br />In part 3 of this series, Mansur and Hashim will be exploring Hindusim or Sanatan Dharma with Adnan Rashid from a historical perspective and its interaction with other religions and cultures.<br /><br />As you all know, at DawahWise, our goal is to educate, inform and inspire you, so that you may be balanced and articulate in your interactions during interfaith discussions. Our aim is to make you aware that we can help build bridges and improve interfaith understanding, and this is in our common interest to do so.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />Because, building bridges through interfaith dialogue is imperative to our future.  Today’s generations will be tomorrow’s leaders. Therefore, it's critical that we focus on constructive, amicable dialogue to remove stereotypes, misrepresentations, caricatures, and mistrust.  We must make the leaders we desire, otherwise others will make undesirable leaders for us. <br /><br />Our esteemed guest, Adnan Rashid, loves history, poetry, travelling, antiquities, books and numismatics. He's a historian with a specialty in the history of Islamic civilization, comparative religion and Hadith literature. He has an honors degree in history from the University of London and is currently pursuing further studies. <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.adnanrashid.co.uk">http://www.adnanrashid.co.uk</a><br />@MrAdnanRashid<br /><br />We will also have br. Abid Ali, who is a graduate of LSE and a keen (amateur) historian joining us to discuss Islam and Hinduism.<br /><br />============<br />Links to previous two episodes:<br />P1 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/0by0DtgVr1Y">https://youtu.be/0by0DtgVr1Y</a><br />P2 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/vUTtWSydqhY">https://youtu.be/vUTtWSydqhY</a><br />============<br />Please Comment, Subscribe, Like and Share this video. <br />Support DawahWise 🤝:<br />Subscribe, Share and Like our videos<br />YouTube 🔗 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/DawahWise?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/c/DawahWise?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />Kindly donate generously and contribute to our ongoing expenses:<br />❤️ Become a member on DawahWise channel to get access to perks:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQwkEQ6EQc4jM2QnrvubBHg/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQwkEQ6EQc4jM2QnrvubBHg/join</a><br />❤️ Patreon:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/dawahwise">https://www.patreon.com/dawahwise</a><br />❤️ PayPal: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://paypal.me/dawahwise">https://paypal.me/dawahwise</a><br /><br />🔗 Please FOLLOW us on Social Media:<br />👉INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/dawah.wise">https://instagram.com/dawah.wise</a><br />👉TWITTER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/DawahWise">https://twitter.com/DawahWise</a><br />👉FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/dawahwise.sc">https://www.facebook.com/dawahwise.sc</a><br />© 2021 DawahWise.
