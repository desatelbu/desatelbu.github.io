{% raw %}Kyle Rittenhouse, the 18-year-old accused of killing two people during a Black Lives Matter protest in Wisconsin last summer, broke down on the witness stand Wednesday at his widely watched homicide trial. Rittenhouse appeared to loudly sob and gasp for air while testifying in his own defense. Judge Bruce Schroede then called for a break in the trial. Fifteen minutes later, a now-composed Rittenhouse described the moment he opened fire on a protester who he says hit him with a skateboard.{% endraw %}
