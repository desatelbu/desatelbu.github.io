{% raw %}Full Comic Story and Review/Recap for The Magic Order, soon to be a TV Show on Netflix. We live in a world where we’ve never seen a monster, and The Magic Order is the reason we sleep safely in our beds. Magic meets the Mob in The Magic Order, as five families of magicians -- sworn to protect our world for generations -- must battle an enemy who’s picking them off one by one. By day, they live among us as our neighbors, friends and co-workers, but by night they are the sorcerers, magicians and wizards that protect us from the forces of darkness...unless the darkness gets them first.<br /><br />=====CREATIVE TEAM=====<br />Writer: Mark Millar<br />Artist: Olivier Coipel<br /><br />=== TIMESTAMPS ===<br />0:00 - Intro<br />1:59 - Character Breakdown<br />4:30 - Issue 1<br />17:24 - Issue 2<br />26:34 - Issue 3<br />33:24 - Issue 4<br />41:36 - Issue 5<br />50:16 - Issue 6<br />59:16 - Final Thoughts<br /><br />===== SUPPORT CHANNEL =====<br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/dannymalt">https://www.patreon.com/dannymalt</a><br />YouTube Channel Memberships: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/dannymalt/join">https://www.youtube.com/c/dannymalt/join</a><br /><br />===== SUPPORT CHANNEL =====<br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/dannymalt">https://www.patreon.com/dannymalt</a><br />YouTube Channel Memberships: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/dannymalt/join">https://www.youtube.com/c/dannymalt/join</a><br /><br />===== FOLLOW OR CONTACT =====<br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://dannymalt.com">https://dannymalt.com</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/dannymalt">https://twitter.com/dannymalt</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/dannymalt">https://instagram.com/dannymalt</a><br />Letterboxd: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://letterboxd.com/dannymalt">https://letterboxd.com/dannymalt</a><br />Email: contact@dannymalt.com<br /><br />===== BUY IT =====<br />Amazon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2ZAgM1L">https://amzn.to/2ZAgM1L</a><br />Comixology: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3ymVz6H">https://bit.ly/3ymVz6H</a><br /><br />DISCLAIMER: The Amazon links above are affiliate links, which means that if you click on one of the product links and buy it, I’ll receive a small commission.
