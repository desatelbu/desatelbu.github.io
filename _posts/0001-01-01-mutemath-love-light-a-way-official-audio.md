{% raw %}Lyrics:<br />Is the race almost over<br />I've been running my best<br />With a weight on my shoulder<br />And the world on my chest<br />I can't sleep though I'm tired<br />I don't know where to turn<br />My head's in the fire<br />My bed's on the curb<br /><br />Love light a way for me<br /><br />I've walked through the valley<br />I've tread on the thorns<br />And still managed to carry<br />The faith that it's torn<br />Let the sky remain starless<br />I won't fear the night<br />Take my portrait of darkness<br />And come frame it in white<br /><br />Love light a way for me<br /><br />Light my path, show me a way <br />Where there's no way, love.<br /><br />Written and Produced by Paul Meany<br />Artwork by Joe Butera and JT Daly{% endraw %}
