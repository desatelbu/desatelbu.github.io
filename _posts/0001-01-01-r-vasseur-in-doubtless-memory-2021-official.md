{% raw %}Heed our call again, dear followers, the time is now, rise for another great sermon from House Of Ygra. The God of The Many welcome you all to his great cathedral!<br /><br />Today, it is our honor to announce the release of Rêvasseur's debut EP, In Doubtless Memory, to the world.  These daydreamers have been honing their craft for the past year in isolation, waiting for this very moment to unleash their brand of great cosmic melodic death metal. Rejoice with us, and take our hands in this path of the unknown, in doubtless memory. <br /><br />Rêvasseur is the third kin to be bounded by blood in House Of Ygra. They are a five piece group with multiple backgrounds, but all with the same goal of playing their own brand of oneiric cosmic melodic death metal (following the great teaching of foregone legends like At The Gates, In Flames and Dark Tranquility). <br /><br />Tracklist:<br /><br />00:00 March Of The Tyrant<br />01:49 Non Timebo Malum<br />05:20 I, The Exile<br />09:42 Days Long Erased<br />13:38 Of Disgrace And Honour <br /><br />Rêvasseur's link:<br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/revasseurband">https://www.facebook.com/revasseurband</a><br />Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/25JWuOZ3xf9VipwHucLTBV?si=jBDvmurHQ6qNuAlvcjak7w">https://open.spotify.com/artist/25JWuOZ3xf9VipwHucLTBV?si=jBDvmurHQ6qNuAlvcjak7w</a><br />Bandcamp: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://revasseur.bandcamp.com/">https://revasseur.bandcamp.com/</a><br />Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtt8h1shmEa6yZIWTr7qYQw/featured">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtt8h1shmEa6yZIWTr7qYQw/featured</a>{% endraw %}
