{% raw %}&quot;I have fought against white domination and I have fought against black domination. I have cherished the idea of a democratic and free society in which all persons will live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal, for which I hope to live for and to see realised. But my Lord, if it need be, it is an ideal, for which I am prepared to die.&quot;{% endraw %}
