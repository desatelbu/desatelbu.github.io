{% raw %}I get the honor of being the first independent journalist to record a 0 to 100% DC fast charge session of a Lucid Air Dream Edition Range. The Lucid Air has a 900-volt battery system and is also an incredibly efficient EV. The combination of those two attributes makes the Lucid Air the fastest charging EV that you can buy today.
