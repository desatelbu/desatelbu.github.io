Their life is full of songs that let them play, laugh and learn, accompanied by their friends: The Musical Animals Cocopiano Bongo, Patty, and many more friends. Singing, Dancing, Learning numbers, and colors, are the perfect mix to laugh and fun in their music world. With just one year, Pop is able to recognize the melodies and follow the rhythm of songs. Especially while dancing. In addition, he loves to dress up as animals and play with musical instruments. Thanks to his friends the Musical Animals Pop manages to improvise incredible melodies of his favorite songs although sometimes they sound a little out of tune. Lea is a 5-year-old girl that has what it takes to be an artist. She loves to dance, to sing and all the musical universe that surrounds her. She likes to customize her clothes, decorate her house and dress up her brother Pop. <br /><br />Enjoy other Lea and Pop Baby Songs <br /><br />The Finger Family - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/SE8PS5P_2GY">https://youtu.be/SE8PS5P_2GY</a><br />Old MacDonald Had A Farm - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/vhMdt1LKMSU">https://youtu.be/vhMdt1LKMSU</a><br />Three Little Kittens - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/CFqOAT7yS4k">https://youtu.be/CFqOAT7yS4k</a><br />The Wheels on the Bus - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/OiJiueTdIOM">https://youtu.be/OiJiueTdIOM</a><br />Zigaloo - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/2Ajdv--Z_J0">https://youtu.be/2Ajdv--Z_J0</a><br /><br />#leaandpop #bestsongs{% endraw %}
