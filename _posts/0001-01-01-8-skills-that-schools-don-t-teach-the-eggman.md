{% raw %}Hey Guys! Welcome to the EggMan Show!<br /><br />Questions have been raised from time to time about the relevance of our education system. Does all the theoretical knowledge you learn at school help you succeed in life later? Of course, attending school and college opens up many opportunities.  That’s why we have so many of them out there. You can show your degree and your chances of getting a job may go up.<br /><br />However, watch the full video to understand why schools might not be living up to the expectations we have from them and why they may be failing to produce future citizens who will perform at their full potential.<br /><br />If you leave out the academic stuff, then it makes us wonder whether schools teach anything else?  Does it equip its students with the necessary skills to grow and thrive in life? <br /><br />To successfully manage our careers and relationships we need to develop certain important life skills. Though schools do impart knowledge, the academic curriculum doesn’t include many other important aspects such as interpersonal skills and financial education which will help a person succeed in life in general. This prevents the child from achieving his or her full potential and inhibits the child’s all-round development.<br /> <br />In this video, we look at the 8 valuable skills that schools don’t teach the kids.
