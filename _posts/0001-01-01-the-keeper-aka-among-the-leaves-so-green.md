{% raw %}I found this song in &quot;Singing Together&quot; and it jogged my memory somewhat. I suspect this was sung by my older brother and other family members before I joined the family song circle so effectively had to learn it from scratch. It is an old English Folk song characterized by its Green leaves and Derry Down refrain. The manuscript form suggests two voices or groups of voices singing in an echo style for the refrain. Being on my lonesome I had to mimic this. I did come in early at one point but it worked anyway so I left it as was so purists do not comment please on this error......I know LOL.{% endraw %}
