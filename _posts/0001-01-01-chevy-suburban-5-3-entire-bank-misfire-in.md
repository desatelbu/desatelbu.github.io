{% raw %}In this video I have a look at a 2007 Chevrolet Suburban that came in with a customer complaint of an entire bank of misfire. A quick scan of the vehicle revealed that it was having issues with all the coil control circuits on bank one. Powers, grounds, ECM? Let's have a look. -Enjoy!<br /><br />If an SMA Video has helped you out please consider giving using &quot;Patreon&quot; to help support us.
