{% raw %}It was going to happen at some point, it was just very sad that the Queen could not make it to the Remembrance Service. Sad for her more than anything. The Queen has only every missed 3 ceremonies at the Cenotaph in her long reign.<br /><br />Worryingly all the member of the Royal Family looked very upset, but I am not sure if that is just because the Queen could not make it. It is a sad reminder that she will not always be here. Charles looked like he was going to cry, but that is understandable after losing his Father this year and in a way one of his sons.<br /><br />I wonder if Harry truly understands how much his actions may have and continue to add to the Queens heartache.<br /><br />On a happier note, I ended up on the news!! Charles had his 73rd Birthday and Peter Phillips his 44th and Sophie got the best patronage in the World!!<br /><br />Taz xx{% endraw %}
