{% raw %}Former SAS team commander Harry Morfitt says it would be “fair to say” that “many dozens have left” the Special Air Service Regiment since the Brereton Report was tabled, including those not accused of anything. <br /><br />I think it would be fair to say that many dozens have left,” he told Sky News host Catherine McGregor. <br /><br />“And there’s also a fatigue in some in the unit but … I would encourage and hope they stay on.<br /><br />“It’s not too late and I think now with a bit of hindsight and the clear light of day, if I can use that expression, there might be some room to reconsider some of the individuals who have taken leave or taken time out or who are in the process of leaving.”{% endraw %}
