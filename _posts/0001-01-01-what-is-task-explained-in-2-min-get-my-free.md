In simple words, a task is a piece of work that needs to be done.<br />It is a small essential piece of a job that serves as a means to differentiate various components of a project.<br />Tasks can be often broken down into micro tasks to make them easier to work on. This is especially handy if your daily schedule is fragmented. <br />So you could use Microproductivity to work utilise snippets of time that you have available throughout the day to work on different Micro tasks.<br />Tasks usually have these characteristics. They usually have an assigned person who is responsible for tasks completion and tasks usually have a due date by which it needs to be completed.<br />There are 3 main categories where most tasks fall into - One - Incidental tasks that you donâ€™t plan for. Two - routine tasks that you do repeatedly and Three - Project tasks that help you to achieve your goals.<br />Tasks can be linked together to create dependencies. This means that you canâ€™t work on task B unless you complete task A. You canâ€™t wash dishes (Task B) Unless you buy Washing-Up liquid (Task A)<br /><br />I hope that you enjoyed this video and I was able to give you a quick overview about what Task is and what role it plays in our life.&quot;     <br />_________________<br /><br />Hi, My name is Janis and Iâ€™m Content Creator and Entrepreneur.<br /><br />One thing that Iâ€™m really passionate about is Time Management.
