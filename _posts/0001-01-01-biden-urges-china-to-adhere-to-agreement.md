{% raw %}The ongoing tension in China continues to worsen. There are reports coming out that China is gearing up to launch a full-scale takeover of Taiwan in the coming years.  <br /><br />As tensions rise between China and Taiwan, President Biden addressed the situation, saying: <br /><br />&quot;I’ve spoken with [Chinese President] Xi about Taiwan. We agree . . . we will abide by the Taiwan agreement. We made it clear that I don’t think he should be doing anything other than abiding by that agreement.&quot;<br /><br />There is nothing for him to abide by. The U.S. is a party to that agreement, but China is not. <br /><br />Visit Our Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.aclj.org?utm_medium=Video&amp;utm_source=YouTube&amp;utm_campaign=09212021Description">https://www.aclj.org?utm_medium=Video&amp;utm_source=YouTube&amp;utm_campaign=09212021Description</a><br />Subscribe to Our Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://aclj.us/youtube">https://aclj.us/youtube</a><br />Request Our Legal Assistance: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://aclj.org/help?utm_medium=Video&amp;utm_source=YouTube&amp;utm_campaign=09212021Description">https://aclj.org/help?utm_medium=Video&amp;utm_source=YouTube&amp;utm_campaign=09212021Description</a><br /><br />#ACLJ #JaySekulow #Sekulow{% endraw %}
