{% raw %}CONTENT WARNING- DISCUSSIONS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT, VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN, CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE.<br /><br />Re-upload after being taken down a 3rd time...<br /><br />(Somehow I didn't put a content warning in the beginning of the video. I apologize for that.)<br /><br /><br />Mike Tyson started a new chapter of his profound career as a boxer and media icon as he battled his way to a “draw” with fellow boxing legend Mr. “Yall Must Have Forgot” himself Roy Jones Jr.  This return to the ring feels like the completion of a story arc worthy of 10 seasons of a Netflix drama.  Tyson has gone from neglected and abused street urchin to world-famous prizefighter, to rock bottom and now back to relevance.  But with his newfound relevance, Tyson seems to have tamed the heinous demons that plagued him and with that experience, he has shifted from sports icon to lifestyle and self-help icon.<br /><br />However, how did he get here? Moreover, what does it say about us and the world that he could make this journey considering the many ugly moments he’s had on his journey.  Is Tyson just another example of poorly behaved men never facing justice, or is he a cautionary tale that provides insight on how to recover from your demons and better yourself?<br /><br />I’d have to say both.  <br /><br />In this episode of the Black Media Breakdown Fiq signifies on the life and career of Mike Tyson.  He looks at everything that made him the baddest man on the planet, as well as all the ways in which we learn more about ourselves and the world through his story.  So take a seat, this is a long one but it’s worth it.<br /><br />03:18 Why we love gladiators like Tyson<br />11:22 Tyson's origins<br />17:55 Tyson's rise to fame<br />23:48 Tyson's fall from grace<br />41:01 Tyson's journey to rebuild<br />48:38 What to take away from this{% endraw %}
