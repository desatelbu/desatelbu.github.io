' The former Irish ambassador affirmed that choosing the EU was a big mistake of the country's leaders. The Irish should have known that the British were not like the rest of the EU sooner.<br />IRELAND &quot;never believed that Brexit would happen,&quot; said a former Irish diplomat. The UK public is not as soft as the Irish. Democracy in Britain is not politics, Irish people only have to look to history to see that Great Britain has always obeyed and stood by its actions.<br />Ray Bassett, a former Irish Ambassador to Canada, Jamaica and the Bahamas, says the Irish government never believed Britain would see Brexit. Mr Bassett has said that then Irish leader Leo Varadkar and current Foreign Secretary Simon Coveney believed the EU would be able to overturn the referendum. The former diplomat has criticized Dublin for what he calls &quot;merciless&quot; and &quot;unnecessary&quot; attacks on Britain's Brexit. It is the stupid actions of the Irish leaders that they are paying the price.<br />✅To watch more videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/misslacibug/videos">https://www.youtube.com/user/misslacibug/videos</a><br />✅Follow me on:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Ukyounews/?ref=page_internal">https://www.facebook.com/Ukyounews/?ref=page_internal</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/DailyBeast6">https://twitter.com/DailyBeast6</a><br />✅Contact us: UKyounews1@gmail.com<br />Have a nice day!<br />#UKYouNews1{% endraw %}
