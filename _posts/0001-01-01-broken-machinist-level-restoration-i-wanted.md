{% raw %}I wanted one of these Starrett precision machinist levels, but I didn't want to pay over $100 for one. I ended up finding one on eBay with a broken vial that I could easily restore which I thought was the perfect option for me.<br /><br />Also, I got a lathe now which is cool. All I gotta do now is make sure my ways are level because they currently are not... Time to go buy some shims and spend a few hours messing around with that.<br /><br />_________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Instagram: instagram.com/Restoration.StationFacebook Facebook.com/RestorationStationFB{% endraw %}
