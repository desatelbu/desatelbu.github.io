The original Mini was developed in response to a fuel shortage in the wake of the Suez Canal crisis. In 1957, Alec Issigonis, the top engineer of the Morris Company, was challenged to design and build a small, fuel-efficient car capable of carrying four adults, and what he built was a perfect balance of fuel efficiency, functionality and fun. It’s from this heritage that the philosophy of MINImalism was inspired. MINImalism is a commitment to doing more with less, and these virtues were not lost on the endlessly inventive mind of racing pioneer John Cooper. He recognized the performance potential in the Mini’s uncompromised simplicity and turned it into a world-champion rally car. <br /><br />The current MINI family builds on the tradition of the classic Mini, adding state-of-the-art technology and modern levels of safety, quality and reliability. And now there is a MINI model to suit just about everyone. Drivers can choose from the iconic MINI Cooper Hardtop, the open-air motoring experience of the MINI Convertible, the versatile MINI Clubman, the surprisingly roomy four-door MINI Countryman, available with all-wheel drive or the new sporty, two-seat MINI Coupe. And all are famous for their creative use of space and nimble go-kart handling. <br /><br />This is the place to get the latest news about MINI.
