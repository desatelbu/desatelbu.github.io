{% raw %}Netflix''s Original Movie &quot;The Discovery&quot; is a philosophical mind-bender with a major reveal in the ending. And if you re-watch it a second or third time, you might see some new rabbit holes to go down or you might see things differently. <br /><br />I’ve watched it 3 times in full and a handful of clips a handful of times. This video is my take on it as of April 3, 2017.<br /><br />Please let me know if you liked the movie, where I was mistaken, what I missed, and any other theories you have. Thanks!<br /><br />- Kev<br /><br />Subscribe to this Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/bkvygs">https://goo.gl/bkvygs</a><br /><br />◑ Game of Thrones: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/U7wEce">https://goo.gl/U7wEce</a><br />◑ The Witcher History and Lore (NETFLIX): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/Y912cg">https://goo.gl/Y912cg</a><br />◑ The Witcher Gameplay: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/dK7p6R">https://goo.gl/dK7p6R</a><br />◑ Westworld: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/h1CGk3">https://goo.gl/h1CGk3</a><br />◑ Altered Carbon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/P3Tcou">https://goo.gl/P3Tcou</a><br />◑ Stormlight Archive: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/uLQyrN">https://goo.gl/uLQyrN</a><br />◑ Ending Explained Videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/ufqHVp">https://goo.gl/ufqHVp</a><br />◑ Movie Reviews: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/dRsHGB">https://goo.gl/dRsHGB</a><br /><br />Almost in F - Tranquillity by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)</a><br />Source: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100394">http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100394</a><br />Artist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://incompetech.com/">http://incompetech.com/</a>{% endraw %}
