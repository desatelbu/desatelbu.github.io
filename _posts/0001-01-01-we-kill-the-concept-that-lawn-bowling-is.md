{% raw %}If you're like me, you barely knew that lawn bowling exist, let alone played by people under 65 years old. <br />I was excited when Aaron Zangle, the US National Lawn Bowling champion, reached out to introduce lawn bowling to me because I wasn't sure how it was played but was eager to give it a try. <br />Aaron gave me a tour of the Hermosa Beach Lawn Bowling Club and a short lesson on how to play.  I'm hooked!  It's not an old persons sport.  <br />This video is made possible through the support of Manhattan Beach Toyota.
