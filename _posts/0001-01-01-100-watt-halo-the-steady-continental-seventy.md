{% raw %}from San Diego, released on Goldenrod Records, 1996.<br /><br />0:00 - Cut With Diamonds<br />3:25 - Set Controls for Hyper Speed<br />7:44 - From Arizona With Love<br />10:15  Blue Sky Stereo<br />13:52 - Death of Cupid<br />20:27 - Dead Air Radio<br />24:20 - Resonate<br />28:48 - Grim and Sexy<br />32:26 - The Uninstrumental<br />41:32 - Magic Missing Song<br /><br />the track listing is a bit wonky compared to the 12&quot; on Discogs but this is the actual sequence this album is meant to be played in (judging by how each track has audio clipping at the end of the next song), perhaps this rip is just weird.{% endraw %}
