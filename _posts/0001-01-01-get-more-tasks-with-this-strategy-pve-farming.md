The PVP Mode of Mercenaries<br />The Mercenaries Fighting Pit is where PVP Combat takes place.<br /><br />Matchmaking aims to pair players that have near-equivalent levels of power - no pay to win here.<br />You can't see which moves your player opponent is locking in, unlike while hunting Bounties, so strategy is supreme!<br />You can earn achievements in this mode, rewards, and with enough practice can top the leaderboards.<br /><br />What is the Mercenaries Travel Point? The PVE Mode of Mercenaries<br />The very top of your village is the Travel Point. It is here where we can access our Bounties and choose which zone we are going to hunt.<br /><br />The Bounties unlock sequentially within a Zone and each has a suggested level and predetermined Bounty Boss.<br />Upgrading the Travel Point will unlock Heroic-level Bounties which provide more challenging content.<br />A future update to Mercenaries will allow an additional upgrade level on the Travel Point to unlock Legendary-level Bounties.<br />This is our main PVE mode to play in with our Mercenaries.<br /><br /><br /><br />#Mercenaries #Hearthstone #Rarran<br /><br />A Complete Guide on How To Get Mercenaries FAST | Hearthstone Mercenaries<br /><br />The Mercenaries You WANNA LEVEL FIRST!
