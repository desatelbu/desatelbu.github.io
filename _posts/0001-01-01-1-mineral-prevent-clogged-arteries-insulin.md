{% raw %}Magnesium prevents muscle spasms of the heart blood vessels, which can lead to a high blood pressure and a heart attack. Magnesium prevents calcium buildup in cholesterol plaque in arteries, which leads to clogged arteries. Magnesium levels are inversely associated with cardiovascular disease risk.  Magnesium also helps direct calcium into the bones and out of the soft tissue within the body.  <br /><br />Clogged arteries result from the build-up of a substance called plaque in the arterial walls. It is also medically referred to as arterial plaque. This plaque can reduce blood flow or even block it altogether.<br />Clogged arteries increase your risk of developing other health complications like a heart attack or stroke. <br /> <br />Some of the most common risk factors for clogged arteries are:<br />High levels of LDL (bad cholesterol) or low levels of HDL (good cholesterol)<br />A high blood pressure<br />Smoking tobacco<br />Diabetes or elevated blood sugar levels<br />A family history of atherosclerosis or clogged arteries<br />Stress<br />Obesity<br />A sedentary lifestyle<br /><br />Most cases of clogged arteries do not exhibit any symptoms until a heart attack or blood clot presents itself.
