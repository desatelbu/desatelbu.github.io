{% raw %}Who is wise? The one who sees the consequences of his actions. Rabbi Berel Lazar.<br />At first glance, sin can seem like something sweet and alluring. But, no matter how it may seem at first, the consequences are always grave. <br /><br />Pleasure comes in two types. The first type is the kind that leaves behind regret for days and weeks. The second type is the kind that comes as a consequence of proper prioritization and lasts much longer. We reflect on this in today's video with Rabbi Berl Lazar.<br /><br />About 'A Moment of Wisdom':<br />  The 'Moment of Wisdom' project was established with the aim of making it accessible to every Jew in simple, clear language, and with concentrated conciseness.  The wisdom, wealth and goodness that there is in Judaism.  While emphasizing the unique spiritual connection that exists between each and every one of the people of Israel.<br /><br />  The reference is to every Jew wherever he is, who can find in the Torah and in the mitzvos a relaxation for the soul and a practical way of life, which will also create for him a solution to the problems and challenges of life, a good relationship, healthy communication, child education, personal growth, and more.<br /><br />  In the channel to be found a very wide range of lecturers and lecturers, first-rate female speakers.  The channel also shows a variety of Judaism and Torah content, including Shabbat, Parshas Shavua, relationships, children's education and more.<br /><br />Join us:<br /><br /> To the YouTube channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/c/MomentofWisdom">https://youtube.com/c/MomentofWisdom</a><br /> To the Facebook page: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://m.facebook.com/Moment-Of-Wisdom-0">https://m.facebook.com/Moment-Of-Wisdom-0</a>{% endraw %}
