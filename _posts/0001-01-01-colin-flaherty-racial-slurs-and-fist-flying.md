{% raw %}Racial Slurs and Fist Flying Swimming Pool Argy Bargy - Colin Flaherty reviews and gives commentary on news with headlines &quot;Brawl involving 40 people at Nashville water park allegedly sparked over racial slurs&quot;<br />[links and excerpts below]<br />by Harriet Wallace Monday, July 9th 2018<br />NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WZTV) — It’s not how you’d imagine your typical family gathering but an all-out brawl between two families, one white and one black, broke out over the weekend at Wave Country.<br /><br />Holt’s hand and eye socket are broken. Doctors are implanting a metal plate in his face Monday afternoon.<br /><br />All after Holt says white men yelled racial slurs at his family and beat them up.<br /><br />“I wasn’t scared. I was just in pain. I wanted the police to press charges, but for some reason they didn’t,” said Holt.<br /><br />They didn’t because police tell FOX 17 News there’s no clear way to identify who is the victim and who is the villain. The white family involved says they were the ones racially insulted and defended themselves.<br /><br />“They had their kids throwing stuff at us calling us white trash this and that and all kind of craziness,” Jonathan Sellers said.<br /><br />Both families agree, saying this all started when a man from the white family bumped into the floats of three black girls.<br /><br />The girls accused him of yelling racial slurs and told their parents — something Sellers disagrees with.<br /><br />Holt’s family says they approached the white men.<br /><br />But this is where the family’s stories split.<br /><br />“With us approaching them, that’s when all the aggression from them started and that’s when we were called the ‘N’ word,” Amanda Holt said.<br /><br />“As soon as I got over there, I said 'what happened? What happened? Then I see fists start flying,” Sellars said.<br /><br />Police say they had to separate 40 people involved in the fight and have interviewed several people. Meanwhile, both families also accuse Wave Country of not having security to keep the fight from starting.{% endraw %}
