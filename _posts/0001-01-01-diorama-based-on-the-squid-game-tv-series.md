{% raw %}What's going on? Is our crafter going to participate in the Squid Game? Almost! But not really! Don't worry guys!<br /><br />So, today we're going to make a diorama based on the Squid Game TV Series! Do you remember the bright, sometimes childlike locations where the characters played various survival games? Let's recreate them in real life!<br /><br />In total, we will create 5 different locations. The first is the money dome room where the characters slept. The second location is the field where the competition with a huge moving doll called &quot;Red light - green light&quot; took place. The third location is a pink and yellow staircase that the characters used to move between the competition rooms. The fourth location is a playground where the characters played the game &quot;Sugar honeycomb&quot;. And the fifth location is a glass bridge! Watch our video to the end to see the entire diorama in full glory! We are sure you will definitely like this craft!<br /><br />Check out more Squid Game crafts on our channel:<br /><br />DIY SQUID GAME GUARD <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/3muMNvBVn0k">https://youtu.be/3muMNvBVn0k</a><br /><br />SQUID GAME MOVING DOLL <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/ANWif-nSGiM">https://youtu.be/ANWif-nSGiM</a> <br /><br />- - - <br />All product and company names shown in the video are trademarks™ or registered® trademarks of their respective holders.
