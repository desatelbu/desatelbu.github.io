{% raw %}Hey!<br />Yesterday it finally was time again. After a long time there was a CUT on a track of the day that was found very early by myself actually and also somewhat viable for the knockout. Usually when cuts are found on tracks of the day they are very complicated and tough to do but the one that I found here was different.<br />The cut in theory only was to jump out to the right after the last checkpoint into the actual safe finish. Definitely wasn't intented by the author to reach the finish that way I guess. Sadly, I needed a bit too long to find out about how to optimally do the cut but I decided to go for it in the knockout nonetheless!<br /><br />Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/granadyy">https://www.twitch.tv/granadyy</a><br />Uncut Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/GranaDy">https://www.youtube.com/c/GranaDy</a><br />Main Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHDes_67fEXHzUnV6CxiDkA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHDes_67fEXHzUnV6CxiDkA</a><br />Clips Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzpaOq5_NbX5KnkIEByiggA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzpaOq5_NbX5KnkIEByiggA</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/GranaDyy">https://twitter.com/GranaDyy</a><br />Discord Server: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/Q25bJnUDxb">https://discord.gg/Q25bJnUDxb</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/granadytm/">https://www.instagram.com/granadytm/</a><br />_____________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Useful links:<br />-Ranking for Cup of the Day: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/cotd_ranking">http://bit.ly/cotd_ranking</a><br />-Openplanet: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://openplanet.nl/">https://openplanet.nl/</a><br />-Openplanet Dashboard Plugin: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://openplanet.nl/files/103">https://openplanet.nl/files/103</a><br />-Support me: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.me/GranaDy">https://www.paypal.me/GranaDy</a><br /><br />Thanks for watching!{% endraw %}
