{% raw %}A deep-seated lipoma that had more to it than what meets the eye! üëÄ<br /><br />Lipomas are slow-growing, benign (non-cancerous) growths of fat cells. These cells are contained in a thin capsule that creates the appearance of a ‚Äúbump‚Äù right under the skin. Lipomas are typically not tender, move around easily, and don‚Äôt require treatment. However, some lipomas may sit in places that cause discomfort to the patient, which is why some people may request removal. Appearance is another reason people may request removal as well. Often a small incision can be made over the lipoma and they can be &quot;popped&quot; out easily, which is a simple in-office surgical procedure under local anesthesia.<br /><br />Join All Access to unlock exclusive member perks:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgrsF4TYwmrV0QsXb8AoeHQ/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgrsF4TYwmrV0QsXb8AoeHQ/join</a><br /><br />SHOP<br />- SLMD Skincare to learn more about my skincare line: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://slmdskincare.com/">https://slmdskincare.com/</a> <br />- Official Dr. Pimple Popper Shop for Comedone Extractors and Tweezers: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.shop.drpimplepopper.com">http://www.shop.drpimplepopper.com</a> <br /><br />__<br /><br />FOLLOW me on Social Media: <br />Instagram: <br />- for 24/7 pops (@drpimplepopper): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3smTOED">https://bit.ly/3smTOED</a> <br />- for my work, my life, my pops (@drsandralee): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2LscBO8">https://bit.ly/2LscBO8</a> <br />- for skincare tips and info on my skincare line (@slmdskincare): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3oHr1IM">https://bit.ly/3oHr1IM</a> <br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3oU3Rz7">https://bit.ly/3oU3Rz7</a> <br />Twitter (@drsandraleemd): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2MXWDM9">https://bit.ly/2MXWDM9</a> <br />TikTok (@drpimplepopper): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2MXWDM9">https://bit.ly/2MXWDM9</a> <br />__<br />DOWNLOAD the Dr. Pimple Popper All Access App:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dr-pimple-popper/id1483066405">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dr-pimple-popper/id1483066405</a> <br />Start Your FREE TRIAL TODAY: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://allaccess.drpimplepopper.com/">https://allaccess.drpimplepopper.com/</a> <br /><br />You can watch my TV appearances here: <br />@Dr. Sandra Lee (aka Dr. Pimple Popper) - TV Appearances <br /><br />My BOOK, Put Your Best Face Forward, is on sale NOW at Barnes and Noble, Amazon, Audible, and Kindle.
