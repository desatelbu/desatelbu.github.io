{% raw %}Storytraveler Mark Hofmeyr travelled with Melvin (@traveldudes), Kash (@budgettraveller), Rob (@bloggeries) and Becki (@bordersofadv) travelled to Serbia: a Lonely Planet top 10 country to visit in 2015 <br /><br />#MySerbia brought to you by iambassador and Serbia Tourism<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://my.serbia.travel/">http://my.serbia.travel/</a><br /><br />Travel to Serbia – See It With New Eyes<br /><br />THE SECRET DESTINATION THAT IS SERBIA<br /><br />Nestled and land-locked between Romania, Croatia and Bulgaria, it’s as though these surrounding countries have outshone the jewels of this land, keeping Serbia hidden from the rest of the world.<br />As travelling filmmakers we’re always on the lookout for undiscovered destinations and travel stories which are becoming increasingly rare and difficult to find, so our recent trip to Serbia sparked great excitement as it was just the type of place we had been looking for – Truly unique, authentic and incredibly beautiful! We know it’s not the top destination on your list, but we’re going to paint you a picture of what we discovered, through our videography, photography and words, that will undoubtedly change your mind and rearrange that list of yours.<br /><br />If you’re wondering if Serbia is for you, here’s the type of person who would absolutely love it:<br /><br />#1 – FOR THOSE WHO LOVE WILD PLACES<br />If for no other reason, come to Serbia for its wild and untouched nature. The landscapes look like watercolour paintings, with pastel shades and hues touching everything the eye can see, from the ground beneath your feet to the very tops of the sky. You can’t help but be immersed in the mystical beauty of it all. <br /><br />#2 – FOR THOSE WHO ARE FOODIES<br />Serbia is the best kept foodie secret, where cultures collide! Eating in Serbia is equivalent to a culinary feast in Turkey, Hungary and the Mediterranean all wrapped into one. With every dish being hearty, creamy and fatty, you’ll not only have a piece of Serbia close to your heart by the end of it, but a great portion on your hips too. But the good news is that it’s 110% worth it and we can guarantee that your taste-buds will love it so much, that they’ll long for these unique flavours for years to come. <br /><br />#3 – FOR THOSE WHO LOVE TO PARTY<br />Belgrade, the capital of Serbia, which boasts some of Europe’s most exuberant nightlife, reflects its golden city lights into the Danube river which hugs its shores - This city has an energy and vibrancy that’s contagious and addictive! During the day we would explore its Bohemian neighbourhoods, covered in colourful wild flowers and dotted with street cafes and at night, every night, we would party! Many say Belgrade is the next Ibiza, with super clubs called “splavs”, on barges that float alongside the river’s edge, filled with gorgeous, young people having the time of their lives on hot summer nights! <br /><br />#4 – FOR THOSE WHO ARE HISTORIANS AND CULTURALISTS AT HEART<br />Belgrade’s beauty stems from it’s astounding architecture and gritty look and feel, adding a very special charm to the city, as it displays evidence of its rich history from generations before us. Pristine museums, castles and churches are any historians dream, telling tales of many wars and cultural shifts. But if you’re not a fan of buildings, every Serbian is like a little history book. They are so passionate about their country that if you show interest and give them half the chance, they’ll tell you all about their country’s entire story, inviting you into their world for an insiders’ look at their cultures and traditions.<br /><br />Serbia’s turbulent past has caused the tourism industry to bypass it, indirectly creating a country so raw and authentic that it inspired us beyond words, leaving us feeling in awe of all we had encountered during our time here.  But unfortunately, like all things in life, this will not last forever and we urge you to see it with your own eyes, before the tour groups get their hands on it. So do yourself a favour and go somewhere unexpected on your next trip, like Serbia – You’ll be surprised by what you find!<br /><br />by Roxanne Boyes<br /><br />Filmed and edited by Mark Hofmeyr on behalf of <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://storytravelers.com">http://storytravelers.com</a> connect on facebook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/storytravelers">http://facebook.com/storytravelers</a><br />Writing: Becki Enright<br />Voice: Don McCorkindale<br /><br />Read more<br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.bordersofadventure.com/travel-to-serbia-balkans-post-conflict-resurgence/">http://www.bordersofadventure.com/travel-to-serbia-balkans-post-conflict-resurgence/</a><br />- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.bordersofadventure.com/nature-in-serbia-a-land-undiscovered/">http://www.bordersofadventure.com/nature-in-serbia-a-land-undiscovered/</a><br />- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.bordersofadventure.com/why-im-travelling-to-serbia-continuing-my-balkans-exploration/">http://www.bordersofadventure.com/why-im-travelling-to-serbia-continuing-my-balkans-exploration/</a><br />- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.bordersofadventure.com/defiant-belgrade-the-heart-of-a-new-serbia/">http://www.bordersofadventure.com/defiant-belgrade-the-heart-of-a-new-serbia/</a><br />- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://budgettraveller.org/40-pictures-that-will-make-you-want-to-visit-serbia/">http://budgettraveller.org/40-pictures-that-will-make-you-want-to-visit-serbia/</a><br />- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://budgettraveller.org/this-is-my-serbia/">http://budgettraveller.org/this-is-my-serbia/</a><br />- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://budgettraveller.org/zdravo-i-am-off-to-serbia/">http://budgettraveller.org/zdravo-i-am-off-to-serbia/</a><br />- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://stophavingaboringlife.com/its-time-to-explore-serbia-myserbia/">http://stophavingaboringlife.com/its-time-to-explore-serbia-myserbia/</a><br />- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://stophavingaboringlife.com/taste-of-nightlife-in-belgrade-serbia/">http://stophavingaboringlife.com/taste-of-nightlife-in-belgrade-serbia/</a><br />- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://stophavingaboringlife.com/getting-to-know-serbia/">http://stophavingaboringlife.com/getting-to-know-serbia/</a><br />- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.traveldudes.org/guidebook/europe-serbia/4273">http://www.traveldudes.org/guidebook/europe-serbia/4273</a>{% endraw %}
