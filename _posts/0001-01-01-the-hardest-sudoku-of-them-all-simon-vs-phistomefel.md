{% raw %}Simon attempted the new Phistomefel puzzle in a livestream.  It's fair to say this is one of the most extraordinary sudokus ever made.  <br /><br />You can find the puzzle here with an example of how it works:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://logic-masters.de/Raetselportal/Raetsel/zeigen.php?id=0008A1">https://logic-masters.de/Raetselportal/Raetsel/zeigen.php?id=0008A1</a><br /><br />You can play the puzzle here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://app.crackingthecryptic.com/sudoku/fLtm97H9GD">https://app.crackingthecryptic.com/sudoku/fLtm97H9GD</a><br /><br />Rules:<br />Every digit from 1 to 9 has to appear once in every row, column and region. <br />The regions first need to be determined. Every region is a set of nine orthogonally connected cells.<br />A digit in a circle indicates the number of borders between regions it sees in its row and column. Note that the edge of the grid does not count toward this total.<br />Remark: There is no negative constraint regarding the circle, i.e. there can be uncircled cells containing a digit that equals the number of edges seen in the respective row and column.<br /><br />Patrons of the channel on Patreon can watch a video where Mark solves the example puzzle from the logic masters link above right now.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/crackingthecryptic">https://www.patreon.com/crackingthecryptic</a><br /><br />*** Our Patreon - The Best Sudoku Club In The World *** <br />You can join us on Patreon for as little as $2/month and access a lot of extra content.
