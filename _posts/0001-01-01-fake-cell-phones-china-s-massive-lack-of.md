{% raw %}In recent years, Chinese manufacturing has been trying to shift to high-end production. Although China has a massive electronics market, its manufacturing sector is still as far apart from world leaders as pineapples are to apples. <br /> <br />In addition to chip shortages, China has begun to see a much more significant shortage of Passive Components, which have also experienced a price hike. Among the common passive components, RCL components including resistors, capacitors, and inductors are the core passive parts, accounting for more than 90% of the total. Since the end of 2020, the biggest price increases in China have been for h or MLCC. MLCC in the electronics industry is like &quot;rice&quot; in the food industry, used in products such as cell phones, computers, home appliances, automobiles. <br /><br />Have questions?
