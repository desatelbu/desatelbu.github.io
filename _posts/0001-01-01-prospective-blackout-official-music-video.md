No God can save me.<br /><br />Blackout<br /><br />You’re cutting me open<br />And it’s leaving me broken,<br />I crawl alone, <br />And I keep on thinking that<br />I’m running out of time, <br />I’m sending a message,<br />This is my last goodbye<br /><br />I can't see through my eyes <br />I can't see through my eyes covered in blood <br />I only see people dying <br />I only see people dying because of war <br />In the name of who? <br />In the name of what? <br />Now you understand the sins <br />And what you’ve done<br />In the name of truth<br />In the name of what ? <br />Now you understand the sins <br />And what you’ve done{% endraw %}
