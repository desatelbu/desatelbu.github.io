{% raw %}Today I welcome back friend to the show, Dr. Al Danenberg. You may remember Dr. Al from his journey with cancer and utilizing the carnivore diet. Well, he's still going strong so I invited him back to hear an update that we've promised you all - and so he can talk about his now robust immune system and what he has done to maintain it, especially now. I can't wait for you to hear what he has to share.<br /><br />More about Dr. Al Danenberg:<br /><br />&quot;Dr. Al&quot; Danenberg is a periodontist and was in private practice for 44 years. He incorporated ancestral nutrition &amp; lifestyle with his leading-edge laser protocol to treat periodontal disease. In September 2018, he retired from the practice of treating individual patients. However, he still consults with patients by phone, Skype, or Zoom regarding nutrition, lifestyle, oral and overall health, and the importance of a healthy gut.<br /><br />Dr. Al received advanced training in evolutionary nutrition from the Kripalu Center for Yoga and Health as well as The Center for Mind-Body Medicine. In June 2014, he received his Certified Functional Medicine Practitioner (CFMP) designation as well as his certification as a Certified Primal Health Coach. In 2015, Dr. Danenberg was appointed to the faculty of the College of Integrative Medicine and created the collegeâ€™s integrative periodontal teaching module. Then, in April 2017, he earned the designation of &quot;ADAPT Trained Health Professional&quot; from Kresser Institute. In July 2017, Elektra Press released Dr. Danenbergâ€™s book, &quot;Crazy-Good Living&quot;, which is based on ancestral nutrition and lifestyle.<br /><br />On April 14, 2020, Dr. Danenberg was appointed the Chair of the Periodontal Committee for the IABDM. He also created the Certification Program for Biological Nutritional Dental Professionals offered by the IABDM.<br /><br /><br />ðŸ‘‰Dr. Daniel Pompa Social Media<br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2We1zLO">http://bit.ly/2We1zLO</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2wEKGzu">http://bit.ly/2wEKGzu</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2HVr0hc">http://bit.ly/2HVr0hc</a><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2WehpGj">http://bit.ly/2WehpGj</a><br />Store: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2ETMglT">http://bit.ly/2ETMglT</a><br /><br />BEFORE YOU EMBARK ON ANY DIET OR NUTRITIONAL PLAN YOU SHOULD CONSULT WITH YOUR PERSONAL MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL. <br /><br />YOU SHOULD NOT RELY ON THIS INFORMATION AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR, NOR DOES IT REPLACE, PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL ADVICE, DIAGNOSIS, OR TREATMENT.
