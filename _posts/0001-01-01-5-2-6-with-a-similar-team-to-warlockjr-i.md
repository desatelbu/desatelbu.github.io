{% raw %}I tried to bring in a similar team (BWCV, Falcon, Cap IW who was underranked) but then I added Kamala and Sparky for fun. Never used Sparky outside of arena. If you would like me to do it again with different champions, I would be willing to do so. <br /><br />I was screen recording on my phone and to ensure there was 0 lost footage I stopped the clips after ~2-3 mins.<br /><br />I tried to keep the fights very basic. Parry, five hits. Didn't go for many intercepts except the Collector. I'm certainly not the best player (dying to Yondu and Collector were both completely my bad) but against Gwenpool that was just a dropped input, may have been I wasn't swiping properly, idk. You could see me throw a few random light attacks (I remember this occuring during the venom fight, and I believe after one of Angela's specials) and those were not intentional. <br /><br />Anyways, I hope this gives you an idea of how your team could work. If you are having trouble with the Collector and not the path, I would be happy to clear the lane with Ghost and try to use the same/similar characters to who you are using. I could try for a solo or at least give you some insight into what your goals should be while trying to do as much damage as possible. When to go for intercepts, parries and the like. I'm sure you can find many videos online that are far better than mine but I am happy to help.{% endraw %}
