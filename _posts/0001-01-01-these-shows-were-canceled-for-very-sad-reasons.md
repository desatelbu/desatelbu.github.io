{% raw %}Every TV show eventually ends. Really successful ones often end on the terms of the cast and creators. Most get cancelled by the network after a drop in viewership, network politics, or because they've simply run their course. But in some cases, other circumstances force a TV series to end production.<br /><br />Maybe one of the cast members has committed a crime or behaved badly in other ways. Maybe world events prevent production. Perhaps the network is worried about political ramifications. Or perhaps a beloved cast member passed away. All those reasons and more can be found here, in our list of shows that were canceled for very sad reasons.<br /><br />#TV #Cancelled #GLOW<br /><br />GLOW | 0:00<br />Schimmel | 1:42<br />Friend Me | 2:38<br />The Sarah Jane Adventures | 3:37<br />Grace Under Fire | 4:57<br />Megan Wants A Millionaire | 6:12<br />Ellen | 7:14<br />Training Day | 8:41<br />The Duggar family shows | 9:34<br />The Jeremy Kyle Show | 10:40<br /><br />Read Full Article: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.looper.com/489198/sad-reasons-these-tv-shows-were-canceled/">https://www.looper.com/489198/sad-reasons-these-tv-shows-were-canceled/</a>{% endraw %}
