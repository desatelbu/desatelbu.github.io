{% raw %}This episode of BIM After Dark Live was inspired by a subscriber's email (Matt).  Matt had a few questions about using an array in Revit to build families and some of the tips and tricks when doing so...<br /><br />So, I thought it would be fun to build an array based family live!  And walk through some of those little &quot;need to know&quot; tips and tricks along the way.<br /><br />Topics We Will Cover:<br />- Creating a nested family and &quot;carrying over&quot; the parameters.<br />- Creating a line based family.<br />- Using and applying arrays<br />- Formulas to drive the array<br />- How to handle single objects and arrays in the same family<br />... and so much more...<br /><br />Don't forget, this is live!  So, you can ask questions and chat with me along the way!<br /><br /><br />Links Mentioned:<br />BIMBOX - Need a New Computer?
