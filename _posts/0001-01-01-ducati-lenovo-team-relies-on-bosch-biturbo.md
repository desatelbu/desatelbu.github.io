{% raw %}Marco Ventura is riveted to the LED screens in the pit lane of the Ducati Lenovo Team. It’s been 18 years since the Ducati chief mechanic took on the job, but every race still electrifies his nerves. Ventura watches intently as motorcycle racers Francesco “Pecco” Bagnaia and Jack Miller swerve through the 13 corners of the World Championship circuit at an average speed of almost 170 kmph. Every race is a technical feat between man and machine, one engineered for extreme speed: Riders accelerate, brake, engage the clutch, change gears and accelerate hundreds of times on the tracks. In these high-stakes, high-speed races, the fates of the 24- and 26-year-old Ducati riders depend on Ventura and his team. A single mistake could cost everyone a victory or worse: The riders could pay for the mistake with their own lives. Ventura takes a deep breath. Today's race is turning out well. The time gap between both riders comes to only 0.49 seconds – a few meters in a race that covers a distance of 110 kilometers. For the last 15 years, Ducati mechanics have depended on power tools sponsored by Bosch Professional to make their tough work easier. Cordless Biturbo tools are the biggest game-changers, shaving split-seconds off the clock and accounting for incredible speed in the pit lane – and on the circuit.<br /><br />Want to learn more about how Biturbo tools can help you overcome all your challenges?
