{% raw %}Dr. Edward Archer, an obesity theorist in the Office of Energetics and Nutritional Obesity Research Center at the University of Alabama, Birmingham, offers a novel and revolutionary theory in the January 2015 issue of Mayo Clinic Proceedings, where he posits a nongenetic evolutionary origin for the obesity epidemic in the United States. He notes that a lack of physical activity before, during, and after pregnancy has evolutionary consequences because it alters nutrient (food) partitioning and energy (fat) storage in current and future generations.
