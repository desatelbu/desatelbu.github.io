{% raw %}~5th Alarm~<br />Date: 11/3/2021<br />Location: Lenox Ave at 135th Street, Harlem. <br /><br />A little after 3am FDNY Manhattan dispatchers received two separate 911 calls reporting smoke rising from the roof of a store on Lenox Avenue. Units along with Battalion 16 arrived on scene and observed heavy smoke pushing from behind roll down gates of multiple closed businesses, the chase began. Roof firefighters cut inspection holes and fire immediately began to vent. The Chief of the 6th Division arrived on scene, observed the heavy fire venting from the roof, transmitted a 2nd Alarm, and ordered all firefighters off the roof to begin exterior operations. By the end of the job there were at least six tower ladders and multiple hand lines operating into multiple stores. It took nearly four hours to bring the blaze under control.{% endraw %}
