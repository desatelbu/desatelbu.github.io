In 2019, Beijing emitted more greenhouse gases than the entire developed world combined. In this special report, we take a look at the magnitude in which China is harming planet earth. And what can be done to stop it.<br /><br />The U.S. Army Secretary says America's military needs to ask itself some hard questions.
