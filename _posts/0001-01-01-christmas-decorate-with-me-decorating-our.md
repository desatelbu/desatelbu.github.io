{% raw %}Christmas time ***DESCRIPTION BOX INFO***<br /><br />Hello dear friends. Welcome to<br />my channel, Graceful Living! I appreciate you stopping by today. If you are new, please<br />let me introduce myself, my name is Deena. I have been married to the love of my life for almost 30 years!!! We have two incredible boys and two little mischievous Boston Terrier girls. I love the Lord with all my heart and my channel and life are centered around Him. My videos are also focused on decorating around my house and of course caring for my amazing family. I hope you enjoy todayâ€™s video and  I would really appreciate it if you would consider becoming a part of our little YouTube family by simply hitting that little red subscribe button. Right now I upload a new video each Tuesday and Friday mornings. Thank you again for taking the time to watch. Have a wonderful and blessed day. <br />**************************************************************************************<br /><br />**************************************************************************************<br />Christmas music <br /><br />MUSIC FOR THIS VIDEO ALSO SUPPLIED BY YOUTUBE STUDIO AND THE FOLLOWING ARTISIT: <br /><br />Carol Of The Bells by Audionautix is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</a><br />Artist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://audionautix.com/">http://audionautix.com/</a><br /><br />Home For The Holidays by Chris Haugen: No attribution was required but I do want to mention he has a YouTube channel and leave his link here for all of you. <br />Chris Haugen<br />  <br />Christmas Homecoming by Aaron Kenny: No attribution was required but I do want to mention he has a YouTube channel and leave the link here for all of you. <br />Aaron Kenny<br />  <br />Central Park by Quincas Moreira<br />No attribution was required but I do want to list their YouTube channel and leave a link her for all of you. <br />  Quincas Moreira<br />  <br /><br />Christmas Village by Aaron Kenny No attribution was required but I do want to mention he has a YouTube channel and leave the link here for all of you. <br />Aaron Kenny<br /> <br />Christmas Chores by RKVC<br />No attribution was required but I do want to mention he has a YouTube channel and leave the link here for all of you. <br />  RKVC<br />  <br />Tis the Season by Nate Blaze <br />No attribution was required but I do want to mention he has a YouTube channel and leave the link here for all of you. <br />  Nate Blaze<br />  <br />Frozen in Love by Aakash Gandhi <br />No attribution was required but I do want to mention he has a YouTube channel and leave the link here for all of you. <br />  Aakash Gandhi<br />  <br />Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</a><br />Source: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100189">http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100189</a><br />Artist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://incompetech.com/">http://incompetech.com/</a><br /><br />Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</a><br />Source: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100270">http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100270</a><br />Artist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://incompetech.com/">http://incompetech.com/</a><br /><br />Bethlehem - Christmas by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</a><br />Source: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100307">http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100307</a><br />Artist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://incompetech.com/">http://incompetech.com/</a><br /><br />What Child Is This by Audionautix is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</a><br />Artist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://audionautix.c">http://audionautix.c</a><br /><br /><br />Silent Night by Eâ€™s Jammy Jams<br />No attribution was required but I do want to mention the artistâ€™s name above.
