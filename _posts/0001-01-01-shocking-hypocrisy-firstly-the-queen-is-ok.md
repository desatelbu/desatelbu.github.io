{% raw %}Firstly, the Queen is ok! This caused a little bit of worry after she pulled out of her Northern Ireland trip. They said it was due to security concerns but as it turned out she was in hospital under the advice of her medical staff! Thankfully it does not seem serious and she just needs to take it easy for a few days. Hopefully we will see her out and about in no time.<br /> â™¥ðŸ‘‘â™¥ Get well soon your Majesty xx<br /><br />So I never thought I would or could be ever shocked by Harry and Meghan's antics after Oprah and The Me You Can't See but looking into their latest money making deal, its apparent that despite preaching to US, the public, they do not seem to care what they are promoting or investing in!<br /><br />Truly shocked at the companies that Ethic have actually invested in and I am shocked at Harry's utter hypocrisy!! <br /><br />Taz xxx{% endraw %}
