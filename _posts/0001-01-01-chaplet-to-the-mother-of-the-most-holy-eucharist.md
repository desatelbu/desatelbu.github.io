Since I am an ardent visitor to the Blessed Sacrament and a Marian devotee, I am very ecstatic to have found a prayer that is dedicated to both Our Blessed Mother Mary and the Blessed Eucharist.<br /><br />Our Mother’s sense of the significance of the Eucharist, while obviously principally focused on Calvary, would have embraced the whole of the life of Jesus and its events: it was all an offering of adoration and reparation to the Father, a single mystery of obedience to His Will, which culminated in the Sacrifice of Calvary. It was not an offering restricted to certain events in His life, but the offering of a Person and, for her, a Mother’s offering of her Son, of Him totally. She had been aware of this from the very beginning, when the Archangel spoke and named Him Jesus, the “Savior”. She knew the prophecies, that the Savior, when He came, would have to be sacrificed for the sins of mankind and, to avoid any doubt, there was Simeon’s prophecy. <br /><br />She could not make the offering at the Presentation in the Temple without being aware that she was cooperating in an early step of her Son’s offering to His Father on the way to Calvary. She was already “Co-Redemptrix.” She lived in the spirit of sacrifice and offering throughout the life of Jesus and, with Joseph, had to form Him in that spirit. So her task as Mother included the preparation of the Supreme Sacrifice in Him and therefore, her living of the Sacrifice within herself. This adds significance to the words, repeated twice “The Mother kept all these things in her Heart, pondering them” (Lk.II: 19 &amp; 51) – not just to be stored away as information in her mind, but to be lived alongside Him.<br />____________________________________<br /><br />A FREE Gift For You...  <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/pray-sg">https://tinyurl.com/pray-sg</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/pray-zen12">https://tinyurl.com/pray-zen12</a><br /> <br />VISIT OUR WEBSITE FOR MORE PRAYERS, CHAPLETS &amp; NOVENAS: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pray-unceasingly.com">https://pray-unceasingly.com</a><br /><br />SUPPORT YOUR PRAYER SPONSOR:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://deloplen.com/afu.php?zoneid=1846519">http://deloplen.com/afu.php?zoneid=1846519</a><br /><br />FOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/prayunceasinglychannel/">https://www.facebook.com/prayunceasinglychannel/</a><br /><br />Please subscribe to our channel for more prayers and novenas.
