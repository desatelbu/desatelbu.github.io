{% raw %}T&amp;D are delighted to host the following up-dated Guest Blog by Sarah Short, Social Media Manager at Panduit. <br /><br />The following article considers The Neccessity Of Lock Out Tag Out (LOTO), Arc Flash &amp; Occupational Safety in the workplace. <br /><br />First things first - what is Lockout Tagout?<br /><br />Introduction to Lockout Tagout<br /><br />Many industrial accidents are caused by the unexpected energisation of electrical equipment or by the uncontrolled release of energy through a failure to implement correct Lockout Tagout. These accidents can be prevented by proper Lockout Tagout procedures. Safe working practices should be implemented in-house which are designed to prevent needless deaths and serious injuries to service and maintenance personnel by controlling unauthorised or accidental use of energy.<br /><br />To perform service and maintenance work on industrial equipment safely, you must understand the importance of energy control and the current regulations - you must also know how to apply energy isolation and Lockout Tagout. <br /><br />Panduit lockout tagout ranges including lockout tags, lockout hasps, valve lockout, cable lockouts, circuit breaker lockouts, IEC lockouts, fuse lockouts, padlock and key cabinets and electrical safety equipment for low and high voltage protection and substations. - See more at: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.cablejoints.co.uk/blog/article/panduit-lock-out-tag-out#sthash.m0yUTlMK.dpuf">http://www.cablejoints.co.uk/blog/article/panduit-lock-out-tag-out#sthash.m0yUTlMK.dpuf</a>{% endraw %}
