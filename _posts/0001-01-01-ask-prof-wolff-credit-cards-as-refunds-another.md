{% raw %}A Patron of Economic Update asks: &quot;It is curious what companies will do in the event of a refund due. I find it very strange that Chrysler sent me a Visa card for the value of a $300 refund they owed me. Verizon did the same thing for a $30 refund.  Why wouldn’t they just send a check? Why on earth would they do this?  Someone benefits, but who?&quot;<br /><br />This is Professor Richard Wolff's video response.<br /><br />Submit your own question to be considered for a video response by Prof. Wolff on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/economicupdate/community.">https://www.patreon.com/economicupdate/community.</a> <br /><br />Ask Prof Wolff is a @Democracy At Work production.
