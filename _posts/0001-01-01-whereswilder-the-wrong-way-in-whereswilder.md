{% raw %}Whereswilder - The Wrong Way In<br />Release Date: October 8th, 2021<br /><br />A moment of epiphany that came when it was least expected. This is the driving force of inspiration behind Whereswilder’s The Wrong Way In.<br /><br />The song tells the story of someone struggling to wake up after a rough night. He tries to get through a miserable day of self-loathing, contemplating on things that were said the night before. As the day goes by he gradually reaches to a rather nihilist revelation:<br /><br />“Every little word we say, well it don’t mean a thing”, a manifesto for humans trying to cope with unhealthy relationships.<br /><br />The Wrong Way In is a soft rock ballad that will take you through this journey step by step. Starting out dark, then lazily progressing to a big anthemic chant, it all fits the narrative. Whereswilder performed the song as a group of four people, all in sync to put this instance of self-reflection into tape. A string section was added later on to build up the dramatic effect.<br /><br /><br />Listen to all digital platforms: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://orcd.co/whereswilder-the_wrong_way_in">https://orcd.co/whereswilder-the_wrong_way_in</a><br />Purchase: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://unitedwefly.com/store/product/whereswilder-the-wrong-way-in/">https://unitedwefly.com/store/product/whereswilder-the-wrong-way-in/</a><br /><br /><br />Music &amp; Lyrics by Whereswilder<br />Arranged by Whereswilder<br />Produced by Whereswilder &amp; John Vulgaris<br />Recorded/Mixed/Mastered at Electric Highway Studios in Athens, Greece<br />Mixing Engineer: John Vulgaris<br />Assistant Engineer: Vassilis Nissopoulos<br /><br />Violin: Kostas Karitzis<br />Cello: Aris Zervas<br /><br /><br />Photography by Evan Maragkoudakis<br />Artwork by Stefanos Pletsis<br />Layout by Giannis Rallis<br /><br /><br />L Y R I C S<br /><br />Ι woke up late<br />Caught up in this feeling that I can’t explain<br />The sky was grey<br />I called you up and said that I was on my way<br /><br />I had a smoke and looked around<br />Made sure that the phone was down<br />And tried to stop myself from going over<br />Every little word we say, well it don’t mean a thing<br />I’d rather let it slip away<br /><br />Some days ago<br />Someone told a story that I’ve heard before<br />But I don’t know if I was ever going to believe a word<br /><br />If you could open up your eyes<br />You wouldn’t think about it twice<br />You’d get a glimpse of all things as they are<br />Jealousy is not a friend it only feeds your fear<br />Very few will understand<br /><br />But let’s not talk about myself<br />Just tell me how’s your day been<br />I might have tried the wrong way in<br /><br />(c) 2021 United We Fly<br />(p) 2021 United We Fly<br /><br /><br />Follow United We Fly:<br />Official Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://unitedwefly.com/​​">https://unitedwefly.com/​​</a><br /><br />Facebook Page: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/unitedwecanfly">https://www.facebook.com/unitedwecanfly</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/united_we_fly">https://www.instagram.com/united_we_fly</a><br /><br />Follow  Whereswilder:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/whereswildergr/">https://www.facebook.com/whereswildergr/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/whereswilder/">https://www.instagram.com/whereswilder/</a><br />Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/1nyRTeshGeP5ikqegDUJBO">https://open.spotify.com/artist/1nyRTeshGeP5ikqegDUJBO</a>{% endraw %}
