{% raw %}Listen to “Day Off” from Cynthia Erivo's upcoming album 'Ch. 1 Vs. 1': <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cynthiaerivo.lnk.to/ch1vs1">https://cynthiaerivo.lnk.to/ch1vs1</a> <br />Follow Cynthia everywhere: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://linktr.ee/cynthiaerivo">https://linktr.ee/cynthiaerivo</a> <br /><br />Super8 Photography by Kirby Gladstein @kirbygladstein<br />     <br />By way of a 12-track journey into her mental and emotional landscape – one marked by heartbreak and sadness, but also triumph and growth – ‘Ch. 1 Vs. 1’ is a record of what one writer calls “the unfolding of a self,” of what it means to do away with the pretense and masks we often wear as a means of survival. It’s eclectic, but not in a nice-nasty way “eclectic” is often used to convey displeasure. Rather, it’s the perfect soundtrack to a still-unfolding talent ready to be seen in her fullness, beyond the stage and screen and high fashion red carpet gowns and extravagant nail art. “Just as me, Cynthia,” she says. <br />    <br />#CynthiaErivo #DayOff #Ch1Vs1<br /><br />Music video by Cynthia Erivo performing Day Off (Visualizer).
