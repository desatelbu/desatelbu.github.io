{% raw %}No I'm not joking. I will be studying 7 foreign languages in 2022. I'll explain why.<br /><br />All of the things listed below can be of benefit to you as well as helping me make better language learning videos. You're awesome, thank you.<br /><br />PATREON: Get extra videos which explain my thoughts on specific things (you ask the questions), articles and interviews with successful language learners:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=38320669&amp;fan_landing=true">https://www.patreon.com/user?u=38320669&amp;fan_landing=true</a><br />A long chat with Veronika from English with Veronika is on its way very soon.<br /><br />One of my favourite language learning apps is called SPEAKLY. Get 40% off any premium membership and help me make better videos by using the appropriate code (6 months or more include all languages no matter which you choose, though you still need to use the appropriate code to the language you click on):<br />ENGLISH: FNS1<br />SPANISH: FNS2<br />FRENCH: FNS3<br />GERMAN: FNS4<br />ITALIAN: FNS5<br />RUSSIAN: FNS6<br />ESTONIAN: FNS7<br />FINNISH: FNS8<br />Find Speakly for ANDROID here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.owlab.speakly&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.owlab.speakly&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US</a><br />Speakly for APPLE here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/ee/app/speakly-learn-languages/id1255478968">https://apps.apple.com/ee/app/speakly-learn-languages/id1255478968</a><br /><br />Another one of my favourite apps is called DROPS.

But it does.)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://languagedrops.com/affiliates/days-of-language">https://languagedrops.com/affiliates/days-of-language</a><br /><br />I sometimes use DUOLINGO and if you decide to get Plus with this link then it will give me a week of Duolingo Plus (note: it doesn't pay me, I just get the week of Plus):<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://invite.duolingo.com/BDHTZTB5CWWKTZNYIFSYVXABYE">https://invite.duolingo.com/BDHTZTB5CWWKTZNYIFSYVXABYE</a><br /><br />The native speaker tutoring shown in my videos is through iTalki.

(Hint: It's not photoshopped, but actually holding such heavy books isn't actually practical for such a photo because they would wobble fall and just generally be a pain... So how did I do this?){% endraw %}
