I haven't made a display scaling stretched res guide in a while so I decided to make an updated one using a guide from a guy named Huncho. He walks you through an advanced display scaling guide in order to get zero input delay stretched res in Fortnite. In addition to that, I show how to use GPU scaling since not everyone has the option for display scaling, and talk about how to fix common issues while using stretched res such as black bars and black screen fixes. Make sure to check out Huncho's guide and follow along with what I do exactly to get the best stretched resolution in Fortnite. Also watch my other How To Get Stretched Resolution On PC Fortnite videos in case you need more help.<br /><br />0:00 Introduction To Stretched Res<br />0:51 Huncho's Display Scaling Guide<br />1:31 Black Screen Fixes (Huncho Step 1)<br />4:53 Step/Part 2<br />10:44 Step/Part 3<br />11:26 Step/Part 4<br />12:03 Step 6: Troubleshooting <br />13:38 Step 5: Nvidia Control Panel<br />14:36 How To Turn Off Read Only<br />15:55 Step 7: Common Questions<br />16:27 How To Reset Your Displays<br />18:08 GPU Scaling Guide<br />20:39 Changing Back To Native<br />21:38 Conclusion<br /><br />As always, if you enjoyed the video feel free to leave a like on the video and subscribe to the channel to stay up-to-date with my content.
