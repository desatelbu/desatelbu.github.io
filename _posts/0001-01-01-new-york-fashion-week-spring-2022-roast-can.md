{% raw %}New York Fashion Week has returned to showcase the Spring 2022 season, and kicked off the first fashion month in the midst of Covid-19. Designers both big and small showcased their collections at a myriad of locations throughout Manhattan and Brooklyn. Newcomers to the schedule included Saint Sintra, Theophilio, Peter Do &amp; Elena Valez who added a genuine vibrancy to the week. Established players like Coach &amp; Michael Kors helped anchor the week because it drew big industry players, and even Thom Browne returned to New York Fashion Week as a way to help bring back some buzz. Overall, it was a return to NYFW that didn't feel blah or uninteresting which was appreciated.<br /><br />0:00 - Intro<br />0:31 - Saint Sintra<br />1:43 - Collina Strada<br />4:34 - Peter Do<br />9:01 - Monse<br />10:45 - Prabal Gurung<br />12:46 - Michael Kors<br />15:55 - Coach<br />18:08 - Thom Browne<br />21:21 - Puppets &amp; Puppets<br />22:05 - Theophilio<br />22:53 - Elena Valez<br />24:08 - Sandy Liang<br /><br />Join this channel to get access to perks:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoEj4uRzynPXEEegNqMnJVw/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoEj4uRzynPXEEegNqMnJVw/join</a><br /><br />Social Media:<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/hautelemode/">https://www.instagram.com/hautelemode/</a><br />Personal Style: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/hautelemess/">https://www.instagram.com/hautelemess/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/HauteLeMess">https://twitter.com/HauteLeMess</a><br /><br />For business inquiries please contact: hautelemode@ellifyagency.com<br /><br />Video Edited by:<br />Rachel Fritz: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/rachelfritz/">https://www.instagram.com/rachelfritz/</a>{% endraw %}
