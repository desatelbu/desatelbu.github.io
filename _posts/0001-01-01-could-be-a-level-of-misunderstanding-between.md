{% raw %}Former New South Wales Liberal leader Kerry Chikarovski says there probably has been a level of misunderstanding between Prime Minister Scott Morrison and French President Emmanuel Macron.<br /><br />Mr Macron was asked by Australian journalists whether Mr Morrison had lied to him when cancelling the Naval Group’s submarines contract at the conclusion of the G20 summit in Rome on Sunday.<br /><br />&quot;I don't think, I know,&quot; Mr Macron said.<br /><br />“I don’t think Mr Morrison speaks French,” Ms Chikarovski told Sky News Australia.<br /><br />&quot;And I know that Mr Macron speaks very good English, but maybe there was a misinterpretation of what was said.”{% endraw %}
