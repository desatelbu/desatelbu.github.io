{% raw %}In a shocking move to many people in the community, legendary AD Carry Rekkles will be playing for team Karmine Corp in the 2022 Season, actually moving away from the LEC and spending some time in the LFL. Now although it’s not likely that he’ll be there for very long, this is still an incredibly interesting move by the player. Many consider this extremely risky for his career and some might say he’s even better off not playing. But in some ways, I think this could be a really great long-term move for Rekkles overall.This is partially me playing the advocate here and understanding that there is potentially some light to this situation, even though on the outside, not many people may think so. <br /><br />Socials:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/quachdaddy">https://twitter.com/quachdaddy</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/quachdaddy/">https://www.instagram.com/quachdaddy/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitch.tv/quachdaddy">https://twitch.tv/quachdaddy</a>{% endraw %}
