{% raw %}I AM CAPABLE TRAILER<br /><br />After experiencing injustice when hiking in the English countryside, Amira Patel decided she wanted to help create a safe space for Muslim women outdoors. She founded her own group, the Wanderlust Women. During lockdown, Amira found a love of wild swimming: it was a place of stillness, in which she could connect to God, yet she always swam on her own… until now. For the first time ever, Amira is joined by two other women to swim together in the beauty of the Lake District. Summaya and Sham are apprehensive upon arrival; it is a big thing for them to be stepping out the box of what is deemed to be normal for Muslim women. After the initial shock wears off, they experience the transformative effect of cold-water immersion. They form a powerful sisterhood, finding strength in one another’s bravery in helping to breakdown the stereotypes and boundaries that exist.<br /><br />This is a film made by an all-woman crew, about women. <br /><br />The film was made for my final submission for my Masters in Wildlife Filmmaking from UWE.<br /><br />Produced and Directed by<br />Roxy Furman<br /><br />Main Camera<br />Katie Wardle<br /><br />Underwater<br />Elizabeth Streeter<br /><br />Additional Photography<br />Roxy Furman<br />Laura Pennafort<br />Cornelia Lee<br /><br />Editor<br />Roxy Furman<br /><br />Colourist<br />Amy Beton<br /><br />Visual Effects<br />Cornelia Lee<br /><br />Music <br />Rosa Di-Finizio<br /><br />Sound Design <br />Galan Fyr<br /><br />Contributors<br />Amira Patel<br />Shamaila Begum<br />Summaya Raja<br />The Wanderlust Women<br /><br />Special Thanks to My Mentor<br />Laura Howard<br /><br />#IAmCapable #TheWanderlustWomen #AmiraPatel #FemaleFilmmaker{% endraw %}
