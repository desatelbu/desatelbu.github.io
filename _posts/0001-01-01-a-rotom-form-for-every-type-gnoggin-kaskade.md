{% raw %}New Rotom Forms? Yes please! Even if they are Fakemon. In this video I'm going to show off some new Rotom forms I commissioned from WescosF! As well as one other Rotom form I commissioned from fkmnOfficial - now known as FkmnTrainerAdam. <br />Then, rather than adding to the pile of similar art, like adding ANOTHER jackhammer-rotom, I'm going to show some other fanart by other artists as well! I take no credit for these at all. Great minds think alike. <br /><br />Check out our merch store to pre-order Tofrug!<br /><br />MERCH!  âž¤   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.gnoggin.net/">https://www.gnoggin.net/</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Additional Credits:<br />If your Rotom fanart is one of the 'unknown' ones, (we spent a loooot of time looking for sources, sorry still though...) Send me an email and I'll get your credit added here.

(and other games sometimes too). Explaining everything there is to explain! Why is each Pokemon given the type it has? What are their origins? What is the lore of the Pokemon world and the design inspirations? And what does it all have to do with alchemy? Let's Go find out!{% endraw %}
