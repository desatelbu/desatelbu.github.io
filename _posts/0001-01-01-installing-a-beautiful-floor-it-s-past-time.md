{% raw %}It's past time for our bedroom to get a beautiful floor. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Follow us on:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/thirdtimearound.ranch">https://www.facebook.com/thirdtimearound.ranch</a><br /><br />***Support our Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://paypal.me/ThirdTimeAroundRanch">http://paypal.me/ThirdTimeAroundRanch</a><br /><br /><br />Welcome to the Third Time Around Ranch. After living in the country most of our lives we still felt like something was wrong. We kept talking about getting back to the basics of life and taking care of ourselves like our great grandparents did. So instead of depending on stores for everything, we bought some land in Alabama where we intend to build debt free on a fixed income and become as self sufficient as we possibly can. We are happy to have you join us as we carve out a new way of life for ourselves and our youngest son.<br /><br />We would love to hear from you, you can leave us a comment or if you'd rather we love to receive mail. <br /><br />Snail mail:     Third Time Around Ranch<br />PO Box 227<br />Webb, AL 36376{% endraw %}
