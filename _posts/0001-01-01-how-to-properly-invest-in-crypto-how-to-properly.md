However, the value is nowhere close to the red zone above 5.00 that has historically marked the final leg of a bull market.<br /><br />The market value represents the total network value of the cryptocurrency and is calculated by multiplying the total circulating supply by the last traded price. Meanwhile, the realized value is calculated by valuing each coin at the price it was last moved.<br /><br />Although bitcoin market valuations may not be cheap, they do not appear to be overstretched either, with there being a scope for an extension of the price rally.<br /><br />“When market value is significantly higher than realized value, it has historically indicated a market top (red zone), while the opposite has indicated market bottoms (green zone),” blockchain analytics firm Glassnode said in the MVRV Z-score explainer.<br /><br />The Mayer Multiple, which measures the spread between bitcoin’s price and the 200-day moving average (MA), also shows the bull market is still far from peaking. While the metric has risen to a five-month high of 1.39, it is well below the 2.4 threshold, above which previous bull markets peaked.{% endraw %}
