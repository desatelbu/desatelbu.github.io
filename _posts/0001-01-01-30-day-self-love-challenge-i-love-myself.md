{% raw %}30 day self love challenge – create miracles in your life<br /><br />To help support this channel you can purchase this and other meditations here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://dauchsymeditations.com/collections/all">https://dauchsymeditations.com/collections/all</a><br /><br />Welcome to dauchsy meditations and welcome to the 30 day self love challenge. My challenge to you is simple. I challenge you to love yourself with intention for 30 days straight. In this video, there are simple affirmations that will change your thinking, and help you truly love yourself. I don’t care if you listen to this video or find other ways of loving yourself, but I challenge you to do something every day for 30 days to love yourself. You can buy yourself something that you may think you don’t even deserve. Spend time on finding out who you are, spend time improving yourself. Take a vacation, splurge on yourself, or you can tell yourself over and over how much you love yourself<br />If you do this, I promise you, You will begin to see miracles in your life. You will see changes in yourself. You will see changes in the world around you. Things will happen to you, people will begin to treat you differently. The world will open up. When people start to love themselves more each day, it’s amazing how their lives get better. They feel better. They get the jobs they want. They have the money then need. Their relationships either improve, or the negative ones dissolve and new ones begin. Loving yourself may seem selfish, but in fact, when we love ourselves, it allows us to love others.<br />So first, before we begin, I want you to make a vow to yourself. Something far greater than just a commitment. A vow that you do whatever it takes to love yourself. Say it to yourself now. I will do whatever it takes to love myself. I will love myself unconditionally. I love myself.<br />Now, with these following affirmations, you can listen to them in the morning, afternoon, night, or while you sleep. You don’t have to listen to the whole video, just listen as much as you would like. <br />You can repeat them, and truly feel them as you speak it, or listen in the background and let it slip into the subconscious mind. <br />If u feel resistance and don’t believe what you are saying, it is ok. Acknowledge these feelings. Feel it for the moment. Then let it go<br />If you feel strong emotions arise, allow them to come up, feel them for the moment, then again let them go.{% endraw %}
