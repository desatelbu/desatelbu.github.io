{% raw %}Ever since I tried this Tudor watch on my wrist, I have not been able to get it out of my mind, so now I own it :)<br /><br />Let me know your thoughts...<br /><br />PS The shark mesh bracelet is just a generic strap I had lying around the house, I honestly cannot recall where or when I purchased it.  Possibly an online shop somewhere many years ago...cheers{% endraw %}
