{% raw %}A day in the life of a JapaneseToy Maker at Sega Toys in Tokyo Japan.  This is what a typical day working in Japan is like at a Toy company as a Japanese worker.  We see Japanese work culture throughout the day and see how it is to work in japan as well how it is to live in Japan during this time before work and after work. Kana works at Sega Toys, creating some of the most popular toys in Japan, formed in 1998 from its parent company Sega, one of the largest video game and entertainment companies in the world.  Although many of the Sega Sammy companies are located in the same building, Sega Toys operate independently with 110 hard working staff to create award winning toys even with major brands like anpanman and disney. Kana is originally from Aichi prefecture but moved to Yamanashi prefecture to attend university majoring in Regional Sociology.  Like many Japanese university students, she started her shushoku katsdo, aka Job Hunting while in school and was able to secure employment before graduation which led her to Tokyo to start a new life and career.  And as a person who has a deep appreciation for all things cute and fun, she naturally found a fit at her job for the last 4 years as a Toy Planner creating Japanese toys.<br /><br />Sega Toys<br />- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.segatoys.co.jp/">https://www.segatoys.co.jp/</a><br />YouTube - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SegatoysChannel">https://www.youtube.com/c/SegatoysChannel</a><br /><br />Watch all of my Japan Day in the Life videos on this playlist<br />- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tokyozebra.com/ditl">https://tokyozebra.com/ditl</a><br /><br />Get my Tokyo &amp; Japan Merch and show your support! <br />- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tokyozebra.com/mrch">https://www.tokyozebra.com/mrch</a><br /><br />--- Tokyo Zebra: My 2nd YouTube Channel ----<br />See My Life in Japan behind the scenes<br />- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/tokyozebra">https://www.youtube.com/tokyozebra</a><br /><br />Questions about Japan or Japan Travel?
