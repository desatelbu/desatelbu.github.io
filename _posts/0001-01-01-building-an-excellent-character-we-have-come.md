{% raw %}We have come to a point in society where most people tend to neglect their character. Some of our favorite motto is &quot;I'm living my best life&quot; which frequently means, I will do as I please and not care what anyone thinks of me. Unfortunately, for those of us that think this way, we must realize that in order to be successful children of God we must care about what people think about us. This is the best way we build character. We must care for people. We must do for others. Once you open up your heart and do for others, take the time to listen to others and understand their wants and needs you will see yourself become elevated in this world in ways you never imagined possible. It is imperative that we open up ourselves to our friends, families and neighbors as LOVE is the key to our one and true GOD. In today's service our beloved prophet walks us through 5 Simple steps to BUILDING AN EXCELLENT CHARACTER. We hope you can follow along and if you enjoy this message, please LIKE, COMMENT and SHARE with your loved ones as it is our mission to get the word of God out to the world. Stay Blessed.{% endraw %}
