{% raw %}I am filming Saltwater Experience this week. Filming calls for very early mornings and LONG days but it is crucial to stick as tightly to my programming as I can. In this episode I go over how I can look over my program before a trip and figure out what few pieces of equipment I could bring with me and modify my programming for the road. I may not improve my conditioning while I am traveling, but I will make sure that I do not take a step backwards. <br />We discuss how you can work with your Coach or trainer to come up with alternatives to your program that allow you to maintain fitness and momentum. All it takes is a little planning.<br /><br />WIN A FISHING VACATION AT HAWKS CAY!
