{% raw %}For decades, mainstream programming languages have drawn similar boundaries around what's a first-class part of the language and what's a third-party addition outside the scope of the language.<br /><br />For example, the language ships with a compiler that reads text files and compiles programs. The package and editor plugin ecosystems are completely separate. Compiled programs have unrestricted access to operating system primitives, unless they're running in a browser. The list goes on!<br /><br />A number of modern languages are drawing these boundaries in different places than where they've been drawn historically. This talk compares some of these languages and their boundaries, and introduces a new programming language that's being developed to draw these boundaries in different places from others have before.<br /><br />Come see what programming can be like when we redraw the foundational boundaries of our languages!<br /><br />--------------------------------------------<br /><br />Philly Emerging Technologies for the Enterprise (ETE) is hosted yearly by Chariot Solutions.
