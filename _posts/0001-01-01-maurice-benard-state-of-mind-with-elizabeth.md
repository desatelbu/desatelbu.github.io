{% raw %}This weekâ€™s episode I'm joined by Elizabeth Hendrickson, who is a talent actress and singer.  You may know Elizabeth best from her roles as Frankie and Maggie Stone on All My Children, Chloe Mitchell on The Young and the Restless or Margaux Dawson on General Hospital. She's also had guest starring roles in the television shows Medium, Cold Case, CSI: Miami and starred in the web series Imaginary Bitches.<br /><br />Elizabeth opens up to me about her childhood and her experiences with anxiety. We talk about the importance of finding a good therapist and going to therapy. Elizabeth tells me about about motherhood having to give birth during Covid... and there may just be a special surprise about the Mickey Mouse Club.<br /><br />--------------------------------------<br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/mauricebenard/">https://www.instagram.com/mauricebenard/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/mauricebenard">https://twitter.com/mauricebenard</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/MauriceBenard/">https://www.facebook.com/MauriceBenard/</a><br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/mbstateofmind/">https://www.instagram.com/mbstateofmind/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/mbstateofmind">https://twitter.com/mbstateofmind</a><br />Learn more about State Of Mind at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.mbstateofmind.com.">https://www.mbstateofmind.com.</a><br /><br />If you'd like to learn more about my life, I've recently released &quot;Nothing General About It - How Love (and Lithium) Saved Me On and Off General Hospital&quot; <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0062973371?tag=harpercollinsus-20">https://www.amazon.com/dp/0062973371?tag=harpercollinsus-20</a>{% endraw %}
