{% raw %}Our clients wanted a family garden that was not only beautiful to look at, but also reflected their cultural ancestry. Islamic gardens embrace a number of their key elements – clean lines, symmetry, sensory planting, the sound of running water and the use of polished paving and decorative screening and tiling – to name but a few! <br /><br /> <br />- And when the client said they wanted a lawn big enough for their table tennis games, we had to oblige! <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Why not get in touch via the website <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thedistinctivegardener.com">https://www.thedistinctivegardener.com</a> or follow us on Instagram @thedistinctvegardener <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/thedistinctivegardener">https://www.instagram.com/thedistinctivegardener</a>{% endraw %}
