One of the most famous ahadith was reported by Anas who said: “I was walking with the messenger of Allah (PBUH), and he was wearing his najraani cloak with a rough collar. A Bedouin came and seized him roughly by the edge of his cloak, and I saw marks left on his neck by the collar. Then the Bedouin ordered him to give him some of the wealth of Allah that he had. The Prophet (PBUH) turned to him and smiled, then ordered that he should be given something (Agreed upon, Fath al Bari, 10/375)”.<br /><br />Lecturer: Brother Yahya Ibrahim<br />Channel: Islamic Motivations:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/IslamicMotivations">https://www.youtube.com/user/IslamicMotivations</a><br /><br />Please subscribe and press the bell (next to the subscribe button) to receive updates and notifications.{% endraw %}
