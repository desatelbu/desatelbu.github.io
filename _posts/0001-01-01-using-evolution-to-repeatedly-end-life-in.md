{% raw %}The best part about creating life is the part where I end it. I start from absolutely nothing but a molten rock and create a bustling planet full of dinosaurs. Then I hit them with a meteor, several times. Before each one I build them back up again for maximum cruelty. Sometimes I just add a lot of creatures, just because I can. I figure the more there is, the more there is to hurt. Unfortunately I lack some of the freedom of creativity to add spikes to my creatures this time. Maybe next time. At least it gives me the option to nuke my creations.<br /><br />Cell To Singularity - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/977400/Cell_to_Singularity__Evolution_Never_Ends/">https://store.steampowered.com/app/977400/Cell_to_Singularity__Evolution_Never_Ends/</a><br /><br />PC Specs - Intel - Core i9-9980XE 3 GHz 18-Core Processor<br />2xNVIDIA - GeForce RTX 2080 Ti 11 GB Founders Edition Video Card (2-Way SLI)<br />Asus - ROG RAMPAGE VI EXTREME EATX LGA2066 Motherboard<br />Samsung - 970 Pro 1 TB M.2-2280 Solid State Drive<br />Corsair - Vengeance LPX 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) DDR4-4000 Memory{% endraw %}
