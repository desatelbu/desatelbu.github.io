{% raw %}Good morning everyone and welcome to today's UK weather forecast on Tuesday 19th October 2021.<br /><br />Current Situation: Low pressure is moving in from off the Atlantic but is drawing up an exceptionally warm southwesterly wind.<br /><br />Today: <br /><br />Most places have started cloudy with outbreaks of heavy and persistent rain in central and western regions. The east is mostly dry. Winds are quite strong and gusty in the west and south but it's a remarkably mild morning.<br /><br />Through the rest of the day outbreaks of rain will continue to push eastwards with central and eastern counties becoming drier this afternoon while the west stays very wet. Temperatures will be exceptionally mild of not warm for the second half of October at 15C to 21C (59F to 70F) though the strong winds will take the edge of the temperature. <br /><br />Tonight:  <br /><br />Much of the heavy rain becomes focused on the south and south east. Elsewhere the wind and rain will clear through with clear spells and a few showers following. A blustery night especially in the north and south. Temperatures will very mild in the south east corner at 15C but colder further north and west where we'll drop into single digits.<br /><br />Tomorrow<br /><br />More heavy and possibly thundery rain spreads across England and Wales while Scotland and Northern Ireland have sunshine and showers before a band of rain and gale force winds arrives in the far north and north west. A colder day with temperatures of 6C to 15C.<br /><br />Outlook:<br /><br />Thursday: A band of rain pushing southwards introducing cold northerly winds and wintry showers to Scotland. Much colder with temperatures staying in single digits in most places.<br /><br />Friday: A few light showers but most places dry with sunny spells. Cold with a risk of frost early and late.<br /><br />Saturday: A cold start, Sunny and dry in the south and east. Turning wet and windy in the west later.<br /><br />***END***<br /><br />‚≠ê Subscribe To GWV:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/GavsWeatherVids?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/GavsWeatherVids?sub_confirmation=1</a> ‚≠ê<br /><br />üí°  Video Credits: üí°<br /><br />W-Z:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.wetterzentrale.de">http://www.wetterzentrale.de</a><br /><br />TWO:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.theweatheroutlook.com/">https://www.theweatheroutlook.com/</a><br /><br />Met Office: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/">https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/</a><br /><br />üí°  GWV Links: üí°<br /><br />GWV YouTube Channel Membership:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKnPg0tFsYu03zThqgU1yTA/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKnPg0tFsYu03zThqgU1yTA/join</a><br /><br />GWV Merch Store: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gavsweathervids.creator-spring.com/">https://gavsweathervids.creator-spring.com/</a><br /><br />GWV PayPal.Me Page: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.me/GavsWeatherVids">https://www.paypal.me/GavsWeatherVids</a><br /><br />GWV Discord:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/rzPh8KJ">https://discord.gg/rzPh8KJ</a><br /><br />GWV Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/GavinPartridge">https://twitter.com/GavinPartridge</a><br /><br />GWV Facebook:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/GavsWeather/">https://www.facebook.com/GavsWeather/</a><br /><br />GWV Instagram:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/gavsweathervids/">https://www.instagram.com/gavsweathervids/</a><br /><br />GWV Streamlabs:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://streamlabs.com/GavsWeatherVids/">https://streamlabs.com/GavsWeatherVids/</a><br /><br />Vlog:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/GavinPartridge">https://www.youtube.com/user/GavinPartridge</a><br /><br />#GavsWeatherVids #UKWeatherForecast #TodaysWeather<br /><br />UK Weather Forecast: Exceptionally Warm With More Heavy Rain (Tuesday 19th October 2021){% endraw %}
