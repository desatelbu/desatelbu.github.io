A graduate of Dartmouth College, he was a senior domestic policy analyst in the Reagan administration.  He also served as a research fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and the Hoover Institution at Stanford University.  <br /><br />He is the author of many bestselling books, including &quot;Illiberal Education,&quot; &quot;What's So Great About Christianity,&quot; &quot;America: Imagine a World Without Her,&quot; &quot;The Roots of Obama's Rage,&quot; &quot;Death of a Nation,&quot; and &quot;United States of Socialism.&quot;  <br /><br />His documentary films &quot;2016: Obama's America,&quot; &quot;America,&quot; &quot;Hillary's America,&quot; &quot;Death of a Nation,&quot; and &quot;Trump Card&quot; are among the highest-grossing political documentaries of all time.
