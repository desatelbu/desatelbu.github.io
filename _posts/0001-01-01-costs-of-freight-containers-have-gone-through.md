{% raw %}Sky News Business Editor Ross Greenwood says the costs of freight containers both in Australia and around the world have “gone through the roof”. <br /><br />“It’s all very well to open the borders and that type of thing, but freight costs not just here in Australia, but around the world have gone bonkers,” Mr Greenwood told Sky News host Chris Smith.<br /><br />“So hence, there could be shortages of goods in our stores.<br /><br />“And this is as a result, of really the cost of actual containers themselves – the cost of bringing a 40ft container has gone through the roof.”{% endraw %}
