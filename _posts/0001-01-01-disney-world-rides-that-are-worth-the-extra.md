{% raw %}Okay...let’s total this. Room on Disney Property. $. Meals $$. Park tickets. $$$ And...what’s this charge for Lightning Lane?? $ You might already know that Disney has officially said bye Felicia to FastPass lanes and replaced them with Lightning Lanes...and those lanes cost money. Yep, you now have to pay to skip the standby line in Disney World. Along with the new Genie+ Lightning Lanes you can get for paying a flat $15, there are eight additional pay per ride options (or, as Molly calls them, “fancy rides”) for Disney World’s most popular, in demand rides. So, which of these eight rides are actually worth the extra cost?<br /><br />-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br /><br />Did you enjoy this video?
