{% raw %}Cars returns in CARS ON THE ROAD, a new Disney+ animated series featuring Lightning McQueen and Mater on a cross-country road trip together. This concept moves racing aside in favor of exploring new worlds, which is risky. Could it actually turn out well for Pixar?<br /><br />Cars 2 is generally agreed upon as the worst Pixar movie because of its generic (and complicated) plot that didn't relate much to the cars themselves. With Cars on the Road following a similar formula of not prioritizing the race aspect of the franchise, it might end up being a disappointment. <br /><br />Welcome to Vailskibum94!<br />Cartoon News ✧ Reviews ✧ Discussions<br /><br />Subscribe to keep up with my videos → <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/18ZdpzY">http://bit.ly/18ZdpzY</a><br />New to the channel?
