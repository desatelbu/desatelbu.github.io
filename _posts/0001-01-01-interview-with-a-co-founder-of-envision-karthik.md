It is a smartphone app that uses artificial intelligence to read all kinds of text from any surface, recognise faces, describe scenes, find objects, scan barcodes, detect colours and so much more. It is the best all-in-one tool in the pocket of a blind or low vision user for all of their visual recognition tasks.<br /><br />#doinggooddoingbusiness, #impactcity, #TheHague, #impactentrpreneur, #envisionglasses{% endraw %}
