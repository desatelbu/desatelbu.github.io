{% raw %}If you've got a question for Fr. Josh, comment below with #AskFrJosh or share a Glory Story of how God has worked in your life with #GloryStory. Your question or story may be featured in the next video!<br /><br />Today, Fr. Josh tackles a question from Matthew; &quot;Do you think God is calling less people to religious orders or do you think more people are just ignoring the call?&quot; <br /><br />Ask Fr. Josh is the question and answer show to help you navigate life when our Catholic Faith doesn’t give an easy “fill-in-the-blank” answer. In each video, Father addresses one question from three different perspectives: your relationship with God, your relationship with the Church, and your relationship with others.<br /><br />For more Fr.
