{% raw %}In August, we started to make a new version of the Decent Espresso Machine, numbered v1.43.  All our XL/XXL models are now in stock with this.  <br /><br />We still had about 200 machines of v1.42 DE1PRO to build, which is why this newer version wasn't immediately available in the DE1PRO model.<br /><br />Yesterday, I change the &quot;choose a model&quot; page <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://decentespresso.com/model">https://decentespresso.com/model</a> to let you choose v1.42 or v1.43, and wrote up a page about the difference.  The only change is the tablet stand, and this video shows how it works.<br /><br />If you're indifferent to the tablet stand improvement improvement, you can save USD $100 by buying the v1.42 model now.  <br /><br />I've started taking pre-orders now for the DE1PRO v1.43, and they'll ship toward the end of November.<br /><br />We've been working extra hard since July to build up stock of machines for the Christmas season. At the moment, we have stock of all Decent models.<br /><br />The barrage of news about chip and parts shortages has spooked me, and we've been investing virtually all our profits into building up stock of parts.  We're paying a premium, of course, but that's much better than risking &quot;factory slowed down or closed&quot;, which surprisingly many companies are having to do.<br /><br />-john{% endraw %}
