We are a Christian couple, who are totally in love and we got married in August 2020. <br /><br />Winston was born with a condition known as Ostegenesis Imperfecta, a disorder that causes his bones to be extremely fragile. He has suffered over 200 fractures in his lifetime and uses a wheelchair for mobility. Mayfair is perfectly able-bodied and loves looking after her physical and mental wellbeing - although she admits that she doesn't enjoy running!<br /><br />Winston is a Motivational Speaker whose work has been featured by international brands including Google and TED talks. Mayfair is a Life Coach and Author who published her debut book The Becoming at the tender age of 21.<br /><br />Our purpose is to document our day-to-day life as an interabled couple, and address some of the stigmas around disability and relationships. Our ultimate mission is to create a world that is kinder and more inclusive for everyone.{% endraw %}
