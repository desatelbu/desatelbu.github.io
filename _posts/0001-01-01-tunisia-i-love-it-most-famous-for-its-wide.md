{% raw %}Tunis, the vibrant capital of Tunisia wherein I visited four times, the last one was in 2012, those visits gave me a chance to go to the wide array of historical attractions in Tunis, the likes of... Cathedral of St. Vincent de Paul, Bab el Bhar,  Al-Zaytuna Mosque, and others.  <br />I Had the chance also to visit Sidi Bou Said, the Mediterranean side of Tunisia, wherein you will find the white and blue house with huge Arabic-type doors. <br /><br />Short information about the place of visit.<br /><br />The Cathedral of St. Vincent de Paul - is a Roman Catholic church located in Tunis, Tunisia. The cathedral is dedicated to Saint Vincent de Paul, patron saint of charity. It is the episcopal see of the Archdiocese of Tunis and is situated at Place de l'Ind√©pendence in Ville Nouvelle, a crossroads between Avenue Habib Bourguiba and Avenue de France, opposite the French embassy. The church, designed by L. Bonnet-Labranche, was built in a mixture of styles, including Moorish revival, Gothic revival, and Neo-Byzantine architectural traditions. Construction began in 1893 and the church was opened at Christmas 1897, albeit without its belltowers owing to a shortage of funds. The reinforced concrete towers were completed in 1910 using the Hennebique technique. Cardinal Charles Lavigerie laid the first stone for a church on 7 November 1881, a little further down Avenue de la Marine. This was a pro-cathedral; the cathedral of the archdiocese being the Saint Louis Cathedral. The pro-cathedral was built quickly, but its condition soon deteriorated due to the adverse ground conditions, necessitating the construction of the current cathedral. Wikipedia<br /><br />Bab el Bhar, - Also known as Porte De France, is a city gate in Tunis, the capital of Tunisia. It marks the separation between the Medina of Tunis and the European city. The gate is made up of a lowered archway and topped by a crenelated parapet. Wikipedia{% endraw %}
