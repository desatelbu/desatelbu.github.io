{% raw %}** The concrete crew has arrived to build the bin pads but we have caught a few rains (which Mike welcomes) but the bin crew does not! ðŸ˜‚<br /><br />Due to the fact that Mike doesn't have his yard fully completed, and that there's no gravel going in and out, which also means there will be no concrete trucks coming anytime soon.<br /><br />Mike also jumps back on his Fendt 724 and does some discing in the rain, which I do believe is the last discing video.<br /><br /><br />** For alot more material such as: <br /><br />* Pictures, * Lens, * Polls, and random fun with both Mike &amp; Ashtyn, then check out my Patreon Account! ðŸ™‚ <br /><br />Otherwise, have a great day! ðŸ™‚<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=25010547">https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=25010547</a><br /><br /><br />** Oh, right! I am back! <br /><br />Also feel free to check out our website to learn a little more about us and check out our merchandise line, we are selling out of some merch and having issues getting restocked. <br /><br />We'll also be discontinuing some lines and adding new ones with some extra cool stuff as well hopefully before Christmas.
