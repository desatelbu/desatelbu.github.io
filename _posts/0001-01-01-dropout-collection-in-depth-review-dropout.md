Bruno and Alex were raised in completely different environments. One from Bali, the other from Burgos (a little more north) had an instant connection that, after a month of knowing each other, led them to create a joint movement that would change their lives forever. <br />&quot;For us, it was all about the hip-hop scene, the rawness of skateboarding and the artistâ€™s creativity which motivated us to imprint a way of living shared through the internet.&quot;{% endraw %}
