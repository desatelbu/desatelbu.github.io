{% raw %}Always wanted this song, I remember that I first heard this version in 2011 on the last concert of the levels tour in my hometown, Avicii open his show with this song. Now sadly Tim has passed away and leave this world with a part of my heart, that was a beautiful night so I decided to edit this song and share it, hope you enoy it like I do.{% endraw %}
