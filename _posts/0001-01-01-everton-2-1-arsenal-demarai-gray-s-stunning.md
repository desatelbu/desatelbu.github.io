{% raw %}Demarai Gray scored a stunning 93rd-minute winner against Arsenal to send Goodison Park wild. Richarlison, who had earlier had two goals ruled out by VAR, equalised on 80 minutes following Martin Ã˜degaard's first-half opener. A deserved victory for the Toffees and brilliant scenes at the final whistle.
