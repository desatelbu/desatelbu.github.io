{% raw %}Imagine a car that can charge using the sun, can generate an income via a car sharing scheme and is also affordable to buy. Sounds like a pipe dream, right? Think again - say hello to Sono Motors' Sion electric car. <br /><br />Jack heads to Northern Munich to see how the 2015 prototype of the Sion has advanced to a 2021 version which has 7.5 square metres of solar panels now beautifully integrated into this spacious and practical electric car. With an average of 70 miles of range being added every week from being just parked outside, and up to 150 on a sunny week, you could feasibly do all of your driving using solar power. But don't panic, you can still charge by plug if you need extra miles!<br /><br />Yes, the Sion might lack luxury and have less tech than other electric cars on the market, but this is what is so great about it as they have designed this car to make it affordable. Also, which other EV do you know of that has moss inside the dashboard? It's straightforward, simple and makes so much sense.<br /><br />Timestamps:<br />0:00 Sunny recharge<br />1:40 Prototype to production<br />2:49 So much solar<br />4:14 Battery &amp; charging<br />5:08 Familiar face<br />6:37 Internal moss!<br />8:04 What's new?<br />9:03 First drive<br />10:32 Always charging<br />11:24 Super solar panels<br />12:23 Flat floor<br />13:05 Why matte black?<br />13:46 Make you money<br />14:55 Big, boxy boot<br />15:57 Just the one Sion<br />16:23 When &amp; how much?<br />17:25 Just makes sense<br /><br />Don't forget to enter 'THE GREAT EV GIVEAWAY' for your chance to win an EV for a year and lots of other top prizes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fullycharged.show/EV-Giveaway/">https://fullycharged.show/EV-Giveaway/</a> <br /><br />Fully Charged is 100% independent thanks to YouTube Memberships and Patreons.
