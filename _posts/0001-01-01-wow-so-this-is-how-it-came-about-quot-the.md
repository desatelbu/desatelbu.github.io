{% raw %}&quot;The process of decay is so gradual that the people themselves are scarcely aware of what is happening. The will of the people is not sufficient to check it, because the people do not see the process of gradual decay&quot;- Benzie. I dare add that language decay and circumstances where words deemed to be archaic give way for new ones to fill in the same contextual position is analogous with the process of falling asleep. It is hardly or never noticed.<br /><br />One of the reasons why the Ga's original name for kenkey known then as &quot;otim&quot; got replaced by &quot;kɔmi&quot; makes this quote that serves as introductory framework to the subject under consideration more relevant than ever. So how did it all happen? <br />The Ga's per the their nature and the kind of occupation, they are accustomed to make them more affinity to corn dough related food. Suggestively, as a fishing community based jurisdiction, the corn dough made into balls covered by corn husk had been found to be highly sustainable in terms of keeping them for longer hours than other related foods. <br /><br />One of the major stages in the process of making the kenkey brought about the name &quot;kɔmi&quot;- for it had always been called &quot;otim&quot;. Naturally, appetite for new stuff and practice within the context of the Ga's and by extension Ghanaians are deemed to be within the normal range of their tradition. Therefore, the introduction of new machines meant for milling the corn into a dough assumed a dramatic prominence over the indigenous way of processing the corn into the final product. Perhaps, the traditional practice had become to cumbersome and monotonous.What is more, the newly introduced practice was seen to be faster and less laborious than the old ways. The corn mill made dough became their daily expression, especially when preferences were being made. This was how it happened- &quot; minsumɔ corn mill nɔ &quot;.Thus, because of the efficient way in which the machines delivered the corn dough, most indigenes expressed interest in that over already known one. An imaginary retrospect of kenkey market scene with special emphasis on the buyers looked like this - 'minsumɔ cornmill nɔ': says the buyer&quot;.<br />This expression had gone through the linguistic processes, corruption and decay leaving behind &quot;kɔmi&quot;.{% endraw %}
