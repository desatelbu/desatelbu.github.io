{% raw %}TAKING MY OWN ADVICE (And Some Sad News.)<br /><br />Having not been out on my bike cycling for several days, I thought I would take some of my own advice and try to silence the slob. I also have some rather sad news from the world of Youtube; I recently heard of the passing of one of my favourite Youtubers. <br /><br />Apetor's video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/NgXsktDgmkk">https://youtu.be/NgXsktDgmkk</a><br /><br /><br /><br />#DesignedForTheRide #MyAltura<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Join my Patreon for an exclusive invite to a live Q&amp;A session with me every month. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/jollygoodvelo">https://www.patreon.com/jollygoodvelo</a><br /><br />Link to buy the Go2/ Insta360 OneX2 camera (affiliate) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.insta360.com/sal/go_2?insrc=INRDXUZ">https://www.insta360.com/sal/go_2?insrc=INRDXUZ</a><br /><br />Buy JGV Cycling Kit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://godfrey.co.uk/club/jollygoodvelo">https://godfrey.co.uk/club/jollygoodvelo</a><br /><br />Email for business enquires: leonard@jollygoodvelo.com<br /><br />Need anything cycling related?
