{% raw %}Your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit, and in order for you to be most effective for the Kingdom of God, you need to be in good health. Satan will sometimes attack the health of good, godly people just like he did in the case of Epaphroditus. If you’re suffering physically and your health is under attack, God wants to take action and release healing into your life. Tune in to Home Group to find out more about how to stand against sickness and receive healing.{% endraw %}
