{% raw %}Sky News host Paul Murray says the public is “not quite convinced” the push from governments to increase immigration is the best way to improve life in Australia.  <br /><br />It comes after a poll published in The Guardian revealed 63 per cent of Australians agree an increase in immigration would lead to more pressure on housing and infrastructure. <br /><br />“Also, 48 per cent of people believe that immigration creates more competition for jobs and it slows the chance for you to get a pay rise – 21 per cent of people are wrong,” Mr Murray said.{% endraw %}
