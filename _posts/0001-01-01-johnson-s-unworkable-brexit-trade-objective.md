{% raw %}Boris Johnson says that he wants Brexit Britain to be exporting a trillion pounds worth of goods by 2030. Unless inflation makes the value of a trillion pounds worth much less than today, it is hard to see how this aim will be met. The government have increased trade barriers to our major markets, and reduced out capacity to produce at even pre-brexit levels. How we're going to export more when we produce less and have a tougher time accessing other markets is beyond me.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/adifferentbias">https://www.patreon.com/adifferentbias</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Philmoorhouse76">https://twitter.com/Philmoorhouse76</a>{% endraw %}
