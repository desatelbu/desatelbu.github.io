{% raw %}The Karroo Theatrical Hotel is home to arguably the most popular drag show in the Karoo. According to its owners, Mark Hinds and Jacques Rabie, guests often have to book months in advance for a weekend experience that includes accommodation, food, and the hotel’s main attraction, the Steytlerville Follies.<br /><br />Described as a “sophisticated cabaret show starring the famous Karoo diva, Dame Leyla Lamborghini performing her dramatic renditions of great songs of yesteryear,” it is presented by “maestro Freddy Ferrari with his mastery of the grand piano”.<br /><br />The Dame and the maestro are the alter egos of the hotel’s owners, Rabie and Hinds. Yet, when the couple met in 2003, owning and running a hotel in the Karoo, not to mention producing and performing their very own cabaret show, was not part of the plan.<br /><br />Maverick Life paid the couple a visit to learn more about their journey to the Karoo, and how in so doing they journeyed deeper into their most authentic selves and gave the Karoo the cabaret it didn’t know it needed. Here is a short film about the fantastic, fabulous Karroo Theatrical Hotel{% endraw %}
