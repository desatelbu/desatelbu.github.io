His latest book is The Good Ancestor: How to Think Long Term in a Short Term World. His previous international bestsellers, including Empathy, The Wonderbox and Carpe Diem Regained, have been published in more than 20 languages.<br /><br />Kate Raworth is a renegade economist focused on making economics fit for 21st century realities. She is the creator of the Doughnut of social and planetary boundaries and co-founder of Doughnut Economics Action Lab.<br /><br />Together, they address the one core question of “What Could Possibly Go Right?” with thoughts including:<br /><br />-That Doughnut Economics offers a model to “meet the needs of all people within the means of the Living Planet”.<br /><br />-That “one of the ways that the world changes is through empathy”, which can overcome our social divides.<br /><br />-That we need to be good ancestors and “step into the shoes of people in tomorrow's world as citizens of the future.”<br /><br />-That recognizing and respecting boundaries is good for our own and the planet’s health, while also being a means to unleash our creativity.<br /><br />Resources<br />Empathy Museum - www.empathymuseum.com <br />Doughnut Economics Action Lab doughnuteconomics.org<br /><br />Connect with Roman Krznaric<br />Website: www.romankrznaric.com<br />Twitter: twitter.com/romankrznaric <br /><br />Connect with Kate Raworth<br />Website: www.kateraworth.com<br />Twitter: twitter.com/kateraworth <br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Follow WCPGR/Resilience.org<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/WhatCouldPossiblyGoRightPodcast">https://www.facebook.com/WhatCouldPossiblyGoRightPodcast</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/buildresilience">https://www.facebook.com/buildresilience</a><br />​Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/buildresilience">https://twitter.com/buildresilience</a><br />​Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/buildresilience/">https://www.instagram.com/buildresilience/</a><br /><br />Rate, review, and subscribe on Apple Podcasts: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/what-could-possibly-go-right/id1520465627">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/what-could-possibly-go-right/id1520465627</a>{% endraw %}
