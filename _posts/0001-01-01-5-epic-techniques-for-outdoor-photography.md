Along the way, we had the opportunity to take a helicopter ride, snowboard, and even try a bit of dogsledding – a great way to take advantage of my outdoor surroundings and record a quick tutorial. <br /><br />The five techniques we’ll be going over are:<br /><br />⁃ Rule of Thirds: Dividing your image into three horizontal and vertical sections in order to take photos that are most pleasing to the eye<br /><br />⁃ Depth of Field: Using aperture and special objects to capture dynamic photos in places where it would be a lot more difficult<br /><br />⁃ Leading Lines: Most commonly used in architecture or built environments, we make this possible in nature buy finding lines that make your subject stand out<br /><br />⁃ Long Exposure: Despite all of the highly reflective snow, you can still use long exposure during the day to capture nature in motion<br /><br />⁃ Aerial Photography: If you have the opportunity or the means, this can add very unique photos to your portfolio just to get a different perspective<br /><br />As mentioned as well, I finally have my prints up on my website. Check them out and let me know what you think!{% endraw %}
