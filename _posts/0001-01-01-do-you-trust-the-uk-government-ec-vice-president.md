{% raw %}Maroš Šefčovič the European Commission Vice President was challenged by a BBC journalist as to whether he trusts the UK government.  His answer was telling.  The EU has engaged with both communities in NI, it has listened to the concerns of industry and applied flexibilities to the protocol.
