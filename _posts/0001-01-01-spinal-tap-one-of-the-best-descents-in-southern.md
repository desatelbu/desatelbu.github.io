{% raw %}Spinal Tap in Richfield, Utah is not to be missed if you are in the area. Kudos to the builders of this one, the utilization of natural features is absolutely next-level. James Weingarten and I had great time unpacking the puzzle that this one offers. If you are traveling between Moab and Saint George, this is a logical stop to spin the legs out for a couple of hours. This one can be shuttled or accessed by pedaling. #followcamfriday approved. <br /><br />James Business- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/AnimalFundraiser">https://bit.ly/AnimalFundraiser</a><br /><br />Join me on Patreon for Top to bottom, uncensored versions so that you do not miss any of the action- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/LongFormatVideos">http://bit.ly/LongFormatVideos</a><br /><br />If you have been enjoying my content over the years, the easiest way to support this channel is to support my friends over at Worldwide Cyclery.
