{% raw %}Han Chinese dance in Shandong Yang Ge style<br />漢族舞（山東秧歌）<br />Dancer: Susan R. Lin <br />舞著：林海虹<br /><br />Loosely based on an idea from a famous line in a poem (一枝紅杏出牆來), the dance focuses on the impossibility of romance given the cloistered life of a female during a certain era.  The girl dreams of love, but resigns herself that it can only be just that: a dream.{% endraw %}
