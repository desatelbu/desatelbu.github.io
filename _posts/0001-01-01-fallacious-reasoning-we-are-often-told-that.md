{% raw %}We are often told that schools are where you learn how to think, not what to think. Sadly, almost no school curriculum deals directly with logic and the closely related subject of logical fallacies. <br /><br /><br /><br /> Fallacies are all around us. Just read something online or watch a few minutes of television and you’ll probably encounter examples of people using fallacious reasoning and logical fallacies. In fact, you’ve probably engaged in it yourself. We’re all guilty of it. <br /><br /><br /><br /> Learn more about some of the common logical fallacies on this episode of Everything Everywhere Daily.<br /><br /><br /><br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.audibletrial.com/EverythingEverywhere">http://www.audibletrial.com/EverythingEverywhere</a><br /><br /><br /><br /> --------------------------------<br /><br /><br /><br /> Executive Producer James Makkyla<br /><br /><br /><br /> Become a supporter on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/everythingeverywhere">https://www.patreon.com/everythingeverywhere</a><br /><br /><br /><br /> Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/everythingeverywhere/">https://www.instagram.com/everythingeverywhere/</a><br /><br /><br /><br /> Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/everywheretrip">https://twitter.com/everywheretrip</a><br /><br /><br /><br /> Reddit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EEDailyPodcast/">https://www.reddit.com/r/EEDailyPodcast/</a><br /><br /><br /><br /> Website:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://everything-everywhere.com/everything-everywhere-daily-podcast/">https://everything-everywhere.com/everything-everywhere-daily-podcast/</a>{% endraw %}
