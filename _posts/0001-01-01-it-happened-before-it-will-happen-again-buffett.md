{% raw %}Warren Buffett warns new entrants to the stock market that stocks don’t always go up and none of the publicly-traded companies that were on the top 20 list 30 years ago made it to the new top 20 list of today. He also gives auto-manufacturers of the 20th century as an example and elaborates on the fact that the vast majority of them went bankrupt although the industry was booming. Buffett warns that it’s not as easy as it sounds to identify the winners out of thousands of other companies at their early stages. Although this video is not about the stock market crash as many of you may have thought, this idea is much more profound and important to understand.
