{% raw %}Charles, Prince of Wales and his son Prince Harry's relationship has hit an all-time low. Charles rarely speaks to his son, who he calls 'sweet boy' and 'darling boy' in public. Biographer Penny Junor argues that Charles is a distant figure because of his intense focus on work. In 2017, Harry commended Charles for the manner he looked after him and William when their mother died tragically. He also attended the wedding of the royal couple just weeks before Charles' 70th birthday.<br /><br />Since the Duke and Duchess of Sussex left the Royal Family, Prince Charles has been trying hard to maintain contact with his son and his family. In an interview with Oprah Winfrey in March, Harry stated that his father had cut him off financially and that he had stopped returning his calls. Prince Harry has returned to the United States with his wife, Meghan Markle. <br /><br />It's been alleged that Prince Charles and Harry haven't spoken in eight months. Charles has yet to meet his grandchild Lilibet, Harry and Meghan's second child. Author Andrew Morton believes Harry's memoir will put Charles &quot;in the firing line&quot; again.<br /><br />#PrinceHarry #PrinceCharles #RoyalInsider<br /><br />About the channel:<br />Royal Insider Channel is delighted to share news aggregated daily about royal families around the world, especially interesting stories, news about the British royal family.
