Consider helping support this channel, because sadly, sometimes I come across a known grave location with no marker, and sometimes I have bought that person a gravestone. Your donations here can help offset some of these costs.  We have some folks already helping to build a pot for this. Let's try to make some of those names forgotten - remembered. <br />PLEDGE LINKS:<br />PATREON MONTHLY PLEDGE - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/facesoftheforgotten">https://www.patreon.com/facesoftheforgotten</a><br />ONE TIME DONATION - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.com/donate?business=6ZBCL7Y632H3J&amp;item_name=Faces+of+the+Forgotten+Support&amp;currency_code=USD">https://www.paypal.com/donate?business=6ZBCL7Y632H3J&amp;item_name=Faces+of+the+Forgotten+Support&amp;currency_code=USD</a><br /><br />ðŸ”´  Connect up on Faces' INSTAGRAM to see SEMI-LIVE Video &amp; Images at the SCENE, as we produce upcoming episodes:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/facesofthoseforgotten/">https://www.instagram.com/facesofthoseforgotten/</a><br /><br />THIS CHANNEL:<br />_________________________________________________________<br />The Angel face you see is the Haserot, named â€œThe Angel of Death Victorious&quot;. The stoic angel is seated on the marble gravestone of canning entrepreneur Francis Haserot and his family. Holding an extinguished torch upside-down, it represents a symbol of life extinguished. Wings are outstretched and the gaze is straight ahead. <br />IN THE END, DEATH ALWAYS WINS. LEST THE FACES NOT BE FORGOTTEN...<br /><br />This channel is focused on casually walking and viewing a handful of the thousands of forgotten names and faces at various cemeteries near and afar. Seeing their faces up close. And when able, telling the stories behind their names.<br /> <br />Most graves are unknown and lost to history. <br />Some are famous. <br />And some infamous....<br />....and some with tragic endings.<br /><br />#Graves #Cemeteries #Death{% endraw %}
