{% raw %}The Semeru volcano in Indonesia just produced its largest volcanic eruption since record keeping began. This sent a plume of ash, sending a plume of ash 15,000 meters or 49,000 feet into the atmosphere. This ash subsequently rained down on the island of Java, leading to near blackout conditions as the day seemingly turned to night. What had just occurred was a large &quot;pelean&quot; style eruption caused by the collapse of the lava dome at Semeru. So, what will happen next? What evacuations should be ordered? This video will answer these two questions and discuss the ongoing eruption.<br /><br />Social media link(s) of a scientific organization which can provide more up to date information:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/BNPB_Indonesia">https://twitter.com/BNPB_Indonesia</a><br /><br />Special Thanks: @Brace_spirit81, @xiexietong, @BNPB_Indonesia (all on twitter)<br /><br />If you would like to support this channel, consider becoming a patron at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://patreon.com/geologyhub.">http://patreon.com/geologyhub.</a><br /><br />Another way to support this channel is to make an order via our gemstone and geology related etsy store at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://prospectingarizona.etsy.com.">http://prospectingarizona.etsy.com.</a>{% endraw %}
