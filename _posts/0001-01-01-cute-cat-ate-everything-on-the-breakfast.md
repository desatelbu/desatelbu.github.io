{% raw %}It is not possible to have a privately breakfast with your wife in Istanbul. Cute stray cats will never leave you alone. Sausage, salami, ham, jambon and all kinds of cheese are indispensable tastes for cats. In fact, it is not our custom to have breakfast in a place where there are no animals. Cute hungry cat ate everything on the breakfast table. Guess we'll have to make an omelet when we get home. #cutecats #hungrycats #adorablepaws #tabbycat{% endraw %}
