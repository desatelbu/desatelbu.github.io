{% raw %}If you enjoy this content, please like and Subscribe! It really helps a lot :)<br />Also, come say hi on discord!<br />After the original Large Spinner vs Cars I made a month ago, the one thing that really stood out to me about that video was how cool and destructive the green tank was. It was like the perfect thing to throw at the spinner and at the russian town. Every other vehicle got destroyed except the tank ...<br />So, when the tank performed so well, why not make a whole video just with the tanks ... and that's what I did ... I gathered some of the coolest tanks in the game from various mods and put them in the map, along with the original tank. The outcome was just what I wanted. The best possible vehicle destruction vs large spinner. Tanks are just cool :)<br />I hope you enjoy this video :)<br /><br />Join Discord Server :)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/PCkNw2MGzw">https://discord.gg/PCkNw2MGzw</a><br /><br />Join this channel to get access to perks:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFHJ50h0N_dyUr9aSm_7vBA/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFHJ50h0N_dyUr9aSm_7vBA/join</a><br /><br />If you're feeling generous you can buy me a coffee!
