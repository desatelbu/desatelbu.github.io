{% raw %}14nov2021<br />parkway parade shopping centre<br /><br />cyclist pushing his bike across the road fail to check for oncoming traffic.<br /><br />quoted<br /><br />Hope this video serves to educate pedestrians on crossing the road right and safely. <br /><br />This uncle was just about 10 steps away from a pedestrian crossing but he chose to jaywalk. <br /><br />Delivery rider couldnâ€™t stop in time and they collided. Lucky no one was hurt. Both myself and the rider made sure the uncle was fine.{% endraw %}
