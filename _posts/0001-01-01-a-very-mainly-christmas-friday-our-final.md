{% raw %}Our final session for the week ... are you ready for another day of fun?<br />Bring your bells (or a set of keys) and your scarf (or a napkin/serviette) and if you have one, your copy of the 'A Very mainly Christmas' book. Don't forget your 5 Little Angels props as well.<br />This session will certainly bring Christmas just that little bit closer. You'll get to hear the story that started the celebration AND sing lots of songs AND have lots of fun.<br />This session will happen on Friday, 17 December ...{% endraw %}
