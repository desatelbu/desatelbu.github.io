{% raw %}Video presentations accompanied by PowerPoint notes <br />are very effective when it comes to student learning. They <br />provide a convenient way for students to view their professor <br />explaining course content. Note taking is enhanced as the <br />professor introduces new concepts throughout the video <br />lecture while students watch and document key information. <br />These video lectures are relevant to both class readings and <br />discussions that have come up during face to face class meet<br />-<br />ings. Students are allowed the opportunity to ask questions <br />whereby the professor can reply with a video within a rea<br />-<br />sonable time frame. Students in hybrid sociology classes at <br />Lehman College have been very engaged by audio lectures, <br />which are uploaded to the course site in Blackboard. This is <br />supplemented by notes uploaded to a content area called <br />“classroom notes.” Feedback has been consistently positive, <br />with students saying that the recorded lectures help them <br />do well on exams because the recorded lectures cover a lot.{% endraw %}
