Bach composed no original works for guitar, and although several compositions for lute have been attributed to him, his interest in this expressive instrument appears to have been rather limited, possibly because his mastery and knowledge of it was less extensive than of other instruments, such as the violin and keyboard. <br /><br />However, the 20th century still witnessed an increasing interest in the possibility of performing Bach’s music on the guitar. It was in the late 1920s that Andrés Segovia recorded the Courante of the 3rd Cello Suite, and he followed this with the Chaconne from the Partita No.2 for solo violin, later recording the entire work. Julian Bream and Narciso Yepes also made recordings on the guitar of Bach’s music, but it was John Williams who eventually recorded the complete works for lute. <br /><br />These discs focus particularly on Bach’s Suites for lute – including BWV996, now attributed to his pupil J.L. Krebs. Also included is the complete Partita No.2 for solo violin. <br /><br />To ensure that questions of interpretation were considered thoroughly, these recordings were made following extensive study of 18th century performance practice, as well as secondary sources that discuss how Bach’s music was originally played. <br /><br />00:00:00 Suite, BWV 996 in E Minor: I.
