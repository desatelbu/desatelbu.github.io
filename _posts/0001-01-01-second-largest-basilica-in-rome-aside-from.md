{% raw %}The papal basilica of St. Paul is one of the four papal basilicas of Rome, the second largest after that of St. Peter in the Vatican.<br />It stands on the place that tradition indicates as that of the burial of the apostle Paul (about 3 km from the place - called &quot;Tre Fontane&quot; - where he suffered martyrdom and was beheaded); the saint's tomb is located under the papal altar. For this reason, over the centuries, it has always been a destination for pilgrimages.<br /><br />The place has been included in the UNESCO World Heritage List since 1980.<br /><br />More video are about to come, be sure to not miss them:<br />► Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2WorRgM">http://bit.ly/2WorRgM</a><br />► Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/34i3UMM">https://bit.ly/34i3UMM</a><br />► Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/3agL10h">http://bit.ly/3agL10h</a><br />► Visit my site for news, articles, tips and tricks of visiting Rome:<br />     www.danielefromrome.com<br /><br />New content every week here and on my site.
