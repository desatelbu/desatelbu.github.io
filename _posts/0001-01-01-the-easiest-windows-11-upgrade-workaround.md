{% raw %}Microsoft is offering free Windows 11 upgrades for Windows 10 users. But that's if your system isn't one of the growing numbers of unsupported PCs. Windows 11 employs a compatibility checking tool that will stop the upgrade process in its tracks if your system cannot meet its extensive list of requirements. The most significant issues are the lack of a TPM 2.0 chip and an unsupported CPU. Sigh. A widespread problem that seemed impossible to overcome.<br /><br />Luckily, the Internet is full of extremely clever people, and there are several ways you can beat this compatibility check and even these system requirements. Unfortunately, many of these processes appear overly complicated or require additional hardware. We found a method from the YouTube channel Tips 2 Fix that seemed too good to be true. So, we tested it out, and we found out that it was 100% legitimate. Most importantly, it was so easy!<br /><br />We needed a more significant challenge after upgrading two laptops, including an original Microsoft Surface Pro from 2014 and a Dell XPS 15 from 2016. Both of fail the Windows 11 system compatibility checker. We decided to install it on a $200 Lenovo laptop with an AMD processor. A Black Friday deal from 2 years ago!<br /><br />Thank you, Tips 2 Fix, for the fantastic solution. Please check out the original video below:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qswIMbzyLQw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qswIMbzyLQw</a><br /><br />Warning: As with any extensive reconfiguration of an operating system, please make sure that you create a backup of your work before proceeding. Data loss or even hardware failure could result from this operation. If you're skittish about proceeding, do not attempt!<br /><br />Also, the following from Microsoft:<br /><br />&quot;This PC doesn't meet the minimum system requirements for running Windows 11 - these requirements help ensure a more reliable and higher quality experience. Installing Windows 11 on this PC is not recommended and may result in compatibility issues. If you proceed with installing Windows 11, your PC will no longer be supported and won't be entitled to receive updates. Damages to your PC due to lack of compatibility aren't covered under the manufacturer warranty.&quot;<br /><br />#Windows11 #Windows11Upgrade #Windows11UnsupportedPC<br /><br />-----<br /><br />GetConnected brings you technology news, inspiring tech stories, and tips for digital living at home and work.
