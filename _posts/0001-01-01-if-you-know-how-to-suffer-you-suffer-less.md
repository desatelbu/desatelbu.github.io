{% raw %}If you know how to suffer, you suffer much less.<br /><br />In the first part of the talk, Thay explains how to make good use of suffering, learning the art of suffering in order to create understanding, compassion, love and happiness. It is like the mud and the lotus flower, a good gardener knows how to make good use of the mud. In other words, rather than running away from suffering, learning to be in touch with it, embrace it and look directly into it; this has the power to heal. The cessation of suffering is in suffering itself. Having the capacity of listening to our own suffering, understanding it, then we suffer less. <br /><br />Thay explains the chant of Namo Avalokiteshvara.<br />Chanting starts at 39:30.<br /><br />The second part of the talk starts at 1:13:00.<br />In the second part of the talk, Thay explains how to invite to the bell of mindfulness, a practice that brings peace and happiness right away. It reminds you to live deeply every moment, in the here and in the now. You listen to the bell and enjoy, because the energy of mindfulness penetrate your body, your cells, and you are established in the present moment.<br /><br />Also, walking mindfully is an easy way to live deeply every moment. Walking quickly is a habit that was transmitted by our ancestors. When you run, you miss the now. Walking mindfully heals you, nourishes you. You are solid, you arrive at every step. If everybody do the same, the collective energy is powerful and brings peace. Breathing in and breathing out mindfully, you enjoy walking and you arrive home, in the here, in the now.<br /><br />(This is the Dharma talk in the Summer Opening Retreat, held in Upper Hamlet of Plum Village France on the 29th of July, 2013.){% endraw %}
