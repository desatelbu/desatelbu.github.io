Within these 4 sectors…you’re pretty much investing in EVERYTHING that could possibly happen…including, Elon Musk announcing that he’s planning to sell 10% of his Tesla Holdings…and, even more interesting is that - this “Cockroach Portfolio” also includes an equal allocation to BITCOIN…which, I have a feeling…helps increase these returns by a MONUMENTAL AMOUNT. <br /><br />From the stock market perspective…SO FAR, the highest risk adjusted returns…historically…seems to have come from the SP500…MEANING, if you’re young, you plan to hold on for at least 20 years, and you don’t mind the rollercoaster ride along the way…if history is any indication, throwing in an SP500 index fund has the best chance at coming out ahead. <br /><br />On the other hand, if you want VERY similar returns…with even MORE diversification…a TOTAL STOCK MARKET INDEX FUND, that covers EVERYTHING, would give you an even broader investment with slightly less volatility. <br /><br />If you wanted SLIGHTLY more coverage to the “What If” scenario, since - technically - those only cover the US markets - you could allocate 15% to an INTERNATIONAL STOCK MARKET INDEX FUND, so that way - you’ve got some diversification, around the world. <br /><br />And if we go even further, in terms of maximizing returns…there have been multiple articles and studies which now suggest that a 2-5% allocation to BITCOIN could wind up INCREASING your profit substantially, while helping you diversify through a new asset class.  <br /><br />Now, of course…since EVERY INVESTMENT has the potential to DROP in value…there SHOULD be a “safety net” that you keep easily accessible…and, for most people - a 3 to 8 month emergency fund, in a high interest savings account, should be more than enough. <br /><br />So, all of this is to say that: the best way to beat the market…isn’t to beat the market..but, instead, to find the best RISK ADJUSTED RETURN that you can, which - typically happens when you diversify as much as possible.<br /><br />My ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB">https://www.amazon.com/shop/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB</a><br /><br />For business or one-on-one real estate investing/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com<br /><br />*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.
