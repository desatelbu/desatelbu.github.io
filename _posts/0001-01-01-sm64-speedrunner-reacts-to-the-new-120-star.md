{% raw %}Liam has done it again. The SM64 120 star 1:37 barrier has been broken. Will Liam try to lower his speedrun time more or will he disappear once again?<br /><br />merch ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://simply64store.com/">https://simply64store.com/</a><br />twitch ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitch.tv/simply">https://twitch.tv/simply</a><br />twitter ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/SIMPLYN64">https://www.twitter.com/SIMPLYN64</a><br />soundcloud ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/simply64">https://soundcloud.com/simply64</a><br /><br />Edited by oknem<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/theoknem">https://twitter.com/theoknem</a><br /><br />OUTRO SONG ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/vexilion/simply-dedo-on-dedo-vexilion-remix">https://soundcloud.com/vexilion/simply-dedo-on-dedo-vexilion-remix</a><br /><br />NODDERS dedo on dedo. Simply reacts to SM64 speedrunning, specifically the new Mario 64 120 Star World Record. 1 hour, 37 minutes, and 53 seconds. Pretty cool, almost as cool as Mizkif kicking Simply out of his house for not getting the SM64 Speedrun Record. Now, Simply must survive by reacting to speedrun records. Maybe he could live with Sodapoppin and do cooking streams with Nick and Malena. Though npmlol might cook, simpmom is the goat, as show at Maya and alveus sanctuary halloween event. Anyways, SM64 Speedrunning as gone far, but will people like Batora, cheese, or puncayshun get the SM64 120 Star Record? Will Emiru beat Mizkif in a Super Mario 64 Speedrun race and take his kirby box? So many questions, but all I know is that Mizkif mario and Simply Mizkif are some cool keywords. Thank you for reading. <br /><br />#mario #speedrun #sm64{% endraw %}
