{% raw %}The Sky Glass TV is a beefy 4K QLED television coming in three sizes, each packing the same built-in surround sound with Dolby Atmos as well as Dolby Vision HDR smarts. I've been hands-on with this smart streaming TV so here's an early look, ahead of my full review (coming soon).<br /><br />Big thanks to Sky for sponsoring this video!<br /><br />The Sky Glass comes in 43-inch, 55-inch and 65-inch flavours, plus five different colours, each with a built-in wall mount and matching remote. However, with Sky TV's clever voice search built in, you can use your mouth to find whatever shows you want to watch.<br /><br />The display is a UHD Quantum Dot QLED panel with Dolby Vision support. You also have six audio outputs including a built-in soundbar and Dolby Atmos, so Sky Glass sounds as good as it looks.<br /><br />Ports include three HDMI connections, one with eARC, as well as USB and a LAN connection so you don't have to rely on WiFi for streaming on the Sky Glass.<br /><br />Sky Glass TV Chapters:<br />0:00 - So what is Sky Glass?<br />1:00 - Design<br />2:21 - UI and features<br />2:52 - Display<br />3:12 - Audio<br />3:41 - Getting Sky Glass on other TVs{% endraw %}
