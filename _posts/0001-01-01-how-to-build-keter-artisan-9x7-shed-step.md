{% raw %}A perfect blend of modern design and ruggedness, the cleverly architected Artisan 9 x 7 shed provides the ideal outdoor storage solution for your garden. The innovative DUOTECH™ walls are not only highly durable and weather resistant, but they also feature an attractive wood-like texture and paintable surface. <br /><br />Made with a steel-reinforced build, the shed comes with an extra strong roof that can withstand snow loads of up to 200 kg/sqm and a heavy-duty floor that allows you to store even large equipment. The Artisan 9 x 7 also features double doors, windows, and a locking system.<br /><br />These basic instructions also apply to the Artisan 11 x 7 and the Artisan 7 x 7 Sheds.<br /><br />---<br /><br />How To Build<br />0:00​ What You'll Need<br />0:39​ Preparation<br />0:56​ Assemble Floor<br />1:32​ Construct Walls<br />2:32 Install Windows<br />3:01​ Install Roof<br />4:52​ Install Doors<br /><br />---<br /><br />Keter UK | Clever, stylish and durable outdoor storage solutions and garden furniture so you can create amazing spaces.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.keter.com/uk_en/">https://www.keter.com/uk_en/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/keter_amazingspaces/">https://www.instagram.com/keter_amazingspaces/</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/KeterAmazingSpaces/">https://www.facebook.com/KeterAmazingSpaces/</a><br /><br />---<br /><br />For assembly instructions, replacement parts and to view our product range go to our website.{% endraw %}
