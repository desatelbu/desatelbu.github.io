{% raw %}Pierre Åström drives around in a customised Volvo FH with 540 horsepower from 2015, which is used as a tipper truck with extendable tray. Pierre’s view on customised trucks is that you have to have a lot of bling, including chromed details. It’s all about getting noticed and the job gets a lot more fun when driving around in a nice truck.<br /><br />Visit Volvo Trucks website:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.volvotrucks.com">http://www.volvotrucks.com</a><br /><br />Volvo Trucks on social media:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/VolvoTrucks">https://facebook.com/VolvoTrucks</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/volvotrucks">https://instagram.com/volvotrucks</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://linkedin.com/company/volvo-trucks">https://linkedin.com/company/volvo-trucks</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/VolvoTrucks">https://youtube.com/VolvoTrucks</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/volvotrucks">https://twitter.com/volvotrucks</a>{% endraw %}
