This'll be pretty rough.  I'll start from chapter 1 and try to proceed to the end of the game.<br /><br />I won't be using DLC, though I will allow amiibos and other things like it, as long as it's not from the Dragon's Gate menu.  I won't be hiring outside units from other players, either.<br /><br />In Ironman runs, I am not allowed to reset the game, use savepoints, or save states.  Each action or occurrence is as a result, permanent.  Any characters that die will remain dead for the rest of the run, and if I lose the game, the run is over.<br /><br />If I fail the run and need to restart, I will begin at the Branch of Fate, meaning I will not need to replay chapters 1-6.  This is mostly because the earlier chapters aren't really part of the Conquest route.<br /><br />Support me on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/excelblem">https://www.patreon.com/excelblem</a><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/excelblem?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/c/excelblem?sub_confirmation=1</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/excelblem">https://twitter.com/excelblem</a><br />Join to get emotes:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMFlIQA0HBpk1czdHa9i15g/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMFlIQA0HBpk1czdHa9i15g/join</a><br /><br />#FireEmblem{% endraw %}
