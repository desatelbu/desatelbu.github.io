After being overfed by your owner, you escape into the ocean and begin to eat everything that you encounter. The more you eat, the bigger you get!<br /><br />In addition to the goldfish, you can also play as a hungry dolphin and a ravenous shark. The dolphin starts off as an overworked aquarium star, forced to jump through flaming hoops for food. He escapes from captivity by eating his way through the aquarium and taking revenge on his trainer. The shark is the final playable character, an artificial fish created by scientists to save Earth's oceans. It uses self-replicating nano technology to consume everything in its path and convert their matter into its own. There's no telling how big this shark will get.<br /><br />#kindlykeyin #keyin #tastyblue{% endraw %}
