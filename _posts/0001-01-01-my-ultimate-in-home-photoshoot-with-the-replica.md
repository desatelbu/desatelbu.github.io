{% raw %}Your in-home food and product photo shoots are about to get SO much easier! In this video, I’m showing you how I create my ultimate photoshoot step-by-step, using the Replica Studio. <br /><br />We’re talking about creating shadows you love, styling (without bending over), how to use quick changes to create tons of content, and how to easily convert from eye level to flat lay angles. If you own a Replica Studio (or are on the fence if it's right for your shoots), this one's for you!<br /><br />Comment below to let me know what you think of these techniques and the Replica Studio!<br /><br />Learn more about the Replica Studio: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.replicasurfaces.com/products/replica-studio%E2%84%A2">https://www.replicasurfaces.com/products/replica-studio%E2%84%A2</a> <br /><br />Learn more about the Replica Photo Formula Course: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://replicaphotoformula.uscreen.io/pages/formula">https://replicaphotoformula.uscreen.io/pages/formula</a> <br /><br />The video links I promised: <br />My favorite styling compositions: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/znOT1ILoImY">https://youtu.be/znOT1ILoImY</a><br />Styling with reflective Surfaces: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/mRAL8WfS9No">https://youtu.be/mRAL8WfS9No</a> <br />All about natural light and different shadow types: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/eNSy1UWrSJ0">https://youtu.be/eNSy1UWrSJ0</a> <br /><br />The 5-in-1 reflector set I use (not sponsored).
