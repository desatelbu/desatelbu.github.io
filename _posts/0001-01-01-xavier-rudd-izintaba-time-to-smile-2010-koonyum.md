{% raw %}Time To Smile by Xavier Rudd and Izintaba.  Directed by Jeremy Fisher.  From the upcoming album Koonyum Sun,     street date - Week of April 19th, 2010<br /><br /><br /><br />This video features some beautiful slide guitar  from singer/songwriter, Xavier Rudd paired with the heavy grooving bass of bassist Tio Moloantoa and punctuated with the drums and percussion of Andile Nqubezelo - which truly helps to round out the fusion of African and Australian folk sounds.  These former members of the late African Reggae singer,  Lucky Dube's band have rounded out the sound to smooth folky African Grooves you hear now.<br /><br /><br /><br />Xavier, Tio and Andile formed a bond that extended beyond their musical respect for each other in the summer of 2008 at Austrias Nuke festival.  This relationship like their musical tastes reflects a passion for unifying culture, sound and understanding. Moving away from the heavier edged sound that he pursued on Dark Shades of Blue, Xavier is back to his up beat, hip swaying sound that has been his main stay on previous recordings and is now backed by the tour de force of Tio and Andile as- Xavier Rudd and Izintaba<br /><br /><br /><br />Time to smile indeed :)<br /><br /><br /><br />Some of the inspirations and influences to Xavier Rudd can be found in:<br /><br />Angelique Kidjo<br /><br />Lucky Dube<br /><br />Paul Simon<br /><br />Peter Gabriel<br /><br />Dave Matthews Band<br /><br />Jack Johnson<br /><br />Ben Harper<br /><br />Ash Grunewald<br /><br />John Butler Trio<br /><br />Surfers: Taylor Knox, Dave Rastovich, Kelly Slater<br /><br /><br /><br />Xavier Rudd is a proud supporter of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society as well as Surfers Against Sewage<br /><br />Over the last few years, hes graced stages at festivals around the globe, including the Bonnaroo Music Festival, Ottawa Bluesfest, The Great Escape, Bumbershoot, and Austin City Limits, to list a limited few. Indeed, where hes physically been has an immense impact on where hes musically going. He explains: Ive absorbed so much culture and energy from where Ive traveled, and it becomes a part of me.{% endraw %}
