{% raw %}RE Exam Questions and answers, this video shows example questions and how to get the correct answer using your knowledge. Learn how to prepare for your RE Exams and pass. Here you can find some more example questions and answers: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://lets-study.co.za/re1-and-re5-exam-example-questions-and-answers/">https://lets-study.co.za/re1-and-re5-exam-example-questions-and-answers/</a><br /><br />Lets Study has compiled a unique study guide for RE1 and RE5 consisting of 140 pages. Remember the exams are not easy and although it might seem easy to answer multiple choice questions it becomes very confusing quickly when the options are closely related. The only way to get the results you want in the exam is to know and understand the material, in addition the application of what you have learned in real world environments.<br /><br />We offer several workshops at different venues. The workshops are held over two consecutive days where we take you through the study material and what you need to know to pass your exams. During the workshop you will participate in discussion groups while completing mock exams to give you a better idea of what to expect under the supervision of the facilitator.{% endraw %}
