Full video can be found here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd7oRtBxcYE&amp;t=3s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd7oRtBxcYE&amp;t=3s</a><br /><br />Dan Coller and Jayden Mucha flew in for a week to film, hang out, and get lost around San Diego. It was actually pretty awesome dipping into both spot/park books for Jayden and Dan's conflicting styles (high and low) and it was a damn good time (another high), aside from what happened to Travis (the lowest of lows). Thanks to Nathan Williams for killing it alongside the crew, Jacob Cable for the quick guest appearance, and Travis Hughes for being Travis. Heal up soon, my dude. <br /><br /><br />WHAT IS OUR BMX?! <br />In short, we are the Ride BMX staff out on our own. We're building from the ground up and our goal is pretty simple. We want to continue what we love. We want to create great content, feature awesome riders, and contribute, push, and show why we love BMX. We sincerely appreciate any and all support... â€”Ryan Fudger, Jeff Zielinski, Adam Watkins, and Justin Benthien.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://ourbmx.com">http://ourbmx.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/ourbmx">http://facebook.com/ourbmx</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/bmx">http://instagram.com/bmx</a>{% endraw %}
