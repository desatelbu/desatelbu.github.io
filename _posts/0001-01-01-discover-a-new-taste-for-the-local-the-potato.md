{% raw %}The potato. For some, it might be a plain and simple thing. For Latvians, however, it’s a blank canvas that’s full of delicious opportunities that are just waiting to be discovered. For us, it’s the taste of both home and nature, as well as our identity and self-expression - because no two Latvian potato dishes are alike. We hope you’re hungry for adventure.<br />For ideas on where to explore the many flavours of Latvia, visit our blog: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/new-local-taste">https://bit.ly/new-local-taste</a>{% endraw %}
