'Cause you always do what's right<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />Can we just talk a while until my worries disappear?<br />I'd tell you that I'm scared of turning out a failure<br />You'd say, &quot;Remember that the answer's in the love that we create&quot;<br />So much has changed since you've been away<br /><br />[Verse 3]<br />I wish that heaven had visiting hours<br />And I would ask them if I could take you home<br />But I know what they'd say, that it's for the best<br />So I would live life the way you taught me<br />And make it on my own<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />And I will close the door, but I will open up my heart<br />And everyone I love will know exactly who you are<br />'Cause this is not goodbye, it is just 'til we meet again<br />So much has changed since you've been away<br /><br />THE VIBE GUIDE - Your guide to the latest music trends.<br />âž¡ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/thevibeguide">http://instagram.com/thevibeguide</a><br />âž¡ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://snapchat.com/add/vibeguide">http://snapchat.com/add/vibeguide</a><br />âž¡ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://thevibeguide.net">http://thevibeguide.net</a><br />âž¡ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/thevibeguide">http://facebook.com/thevibeguide</a><br />âž¡ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://soundcloud.com/thevibeguide">http://soundcloud.com/thevibeguide</a><br />âž¡ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/thevibeguide">http://twitter.com/thevibeguide</a><br /><br />Send your submissions: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://submit.thevibeguide.net">https://submit.thevibeguide.net</a><br /><br />#EdSheeran #VisitingHours #Lyrics<br /><br />Tags: Ed Sheeran, visiting hours, ed Sheeran visiting hours, visiting hours ed Sheeran, lyrics visiting hours, visiting hours Lyrics, ed Sheeran visiting hours Lyrics, ed Sheeran lyrics visiting hours, visiting hours Lyrics ed Sheeran, visiting hours ed Sheeran lyrics, lyrics visiting hours ed Sheeran, visiting hours Lyrics ed Sheeran{% endraw %}
