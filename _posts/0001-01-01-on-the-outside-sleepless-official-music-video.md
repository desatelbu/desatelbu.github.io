Their unique 5-part harmony blend and charisma has helped On The Outside gain over 5 million TikTok followers. Having formed in 2019, OTO has been best described by the press as “if One Direction had a love child with Dan + Shay”. <br /><br />The band has recently added famed Nashville #1 hit songwriter/producer Jimmy Robbins (Maren Morris, Keith Urban, Blake Shelton, Kelsea Ballerini, Kelly Clarkson, Thomas Rhett) to their team.  They celebrate this new chapter with their latest release called “Sleepless”.  The song was penned by band members Andrew Bloom and Jon Klaasen as well as Jimmy Robbins and Laura Veltz (Dan + Shay, Eli Young Band, Chris Young). “Sleepless” seamlessly blends the band’s signature vocal sound with the craft of a pop song and the heart of a country lyric.  <br /><br />#Sleepless #OnTheOutside #OfficialMusicVideo #Country #Boyband{% endraw %}
