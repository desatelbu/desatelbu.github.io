{% raw %}Join A. Vahanian, D. Foley and M.W.Bergmann to review our current evidence and clinical knowledge concerning LAA closure and stroke. How do we interpret trials such as PROTECT AF and PREVAIL in terms of mortality and all-cause death? How do we understand the balance between periprocedural risk in the use of LAA closure as a prophylactic procedure? What is the emerging evidence of the recent EWOLUTION registry? And what do we need to do today in order to build on the evidence – and experience – of these last years in order to have an impact on clinical practice? Join us!<br /><br />This interview was filmed at EuroPCR 2016: see more videos here <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pcronline.com/Cases-resources-images/Resources">https://www.pcronline.com/Cases-resources-images/Resources</a>{% endraw %}
