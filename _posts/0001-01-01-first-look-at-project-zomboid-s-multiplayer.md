{% raw %}In this video I get an exclusive first look at Project Zomboid's multiplayer for Build 41! I'm incredibly fortunate to have got this opportunity to give my early impressions of multiplayer. All of the footage was collected from my play sessions. This video is in no way sponsored by the development team, these are my honest thoughts on multiplayer as it stands right now! I've included some gameplay, as well as Louisville, in this video.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />-------------------------------------- Important Links ------------------------------------------<br /><br />Thursdoid Blog: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://projectzomboid.com/blog/news/">https://projectzomboid.com/blog/news/</a><br /><br />Patreon &amp; Server Whitelists: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/mratomicduck">https://www.patreon.com/mratomicduck</a><br /><br />My Mods: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2584732960">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2584732960</a><br /><br />Buy Project Zomboid: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/project-zomboid?partner=mratomicduck">https://www.humblebundle.com/store/project-zomboid?partner=mratomicduck</a><br /><br />My Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/mratomicduck">https://www.twitch.tv/mratomicduck</a><br /><br />My Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/9NC2GPufAd">https://discord.gg/9NC2GPufAd</a><br /><br />#projectzomboid #multiplayer{% endraw %}
