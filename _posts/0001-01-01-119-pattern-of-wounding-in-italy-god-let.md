{% raw %}In Italy God let me get hurt in a big, deep way. Such that it was difficult to trust or have faith in God. Working through both my trust in God and the wounding has been SO hard. But I’m getting there. As I do, I see that God has been poking an old wound inside me, bringing it to the surface in order to heal it. <br /><br />Is there a pattern to the wounding in your life? If so, INVITE JESUS IN. Say, “Jesus, come into this place. I give you permission to heal it.”{% endraw %}
