Rust xbox is now out, although earlier this month there were rust drops. The rust ps4 however is out right now.<br /><br />The only aim in Rust is to survive. To do this you will need to overcome struggles such as hunger, thirst and cold. Build a fire. Build a shelter. Kill animals for meat. Protect yourself from other players, and kill them for meat. Create alliances with other players and form a town. Do whatever it takes to survive.{% endraw %}
