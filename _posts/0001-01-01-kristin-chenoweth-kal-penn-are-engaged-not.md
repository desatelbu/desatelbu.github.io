{% raw %}James welcomes Kristin Chenoweth and Kal Penn who both are engaged to be married. After Kristin talks about her (somewhat?) laser-like focus on her fiance, Kal talks about his relationship beginning with cheap beer and NASCAR and 11 years later he and Josh are ready to wed. After, Kal recalls a nightmare experience working a party as a mummy, which has Kristin remembering the time she dressed as one for Halloween. And James asks Kristin about her new album &quot;Happiness is...Christmas!&quot;<br /><br />More Late Late Show:<br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/CordenYouTube">http://bit.ly/CordenYouTube</a><br />Watch Full Episodes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1ENyPw4">http://bit.ly/1ENyPw4</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://on.fb.me/19PIHLC">http://on.fb.me/19PIHLC</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1Iv0q6k">http://bit.ly/1Iv0q6k</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/latelategram">http://bit.ly/latelategram</a><br /><br />Watch The Late Late Show with James Corden weeknights at 12:35 AM ET/11:35 PM CT.

Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.&quot;{% endraw %}
