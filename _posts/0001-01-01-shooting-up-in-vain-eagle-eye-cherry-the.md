{% raw %}The song Shooting Up In Vain from the movie &quot;Go.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br />Lyrics: <br /><br /><br /><br />Waking up as the sun goes down<br /><br />Body all in pain<br /><br />Straight out the door to the worst part of town<br /><br />Shooting up in vain<br /><br /><br /><br />Slips all his money to the man<br /><br />Here we go again, here we go again<br /><br />Got bags of mercy in the palm of his hand<br /><br />Shooting up in vain<br /><br /><br /><br />And so he heads for the closest roof top<br /><br />And now he's free with the skyline behind<br /><br />But it won't be long until his high will drop<br /><br />And then you know what he'll try to find<br /><br /><br /><br />Such a shame<br /><br /><br /><br />Now he's back on that hunt for more<br /><br />Body all in pain<br /><br />Wanting to get back to where he was before<br /><br />Shooting up in vain<br /><br /><br /><br />So now he goes and sells his wedding ring<br /><br />Here we go again, here we go again<br /><br />But now he's sold exactly everything<br /><br />Shooting up in vain<br /><br /><br /><br />And so he heads for the closest roof top<br /><br />And now he's free with the skyline behind<br /><br />But it won't be long until his high will drop<br /><br />Then you know what he'll try to find<br /><br /><br /><br />Shooting up in vain<br /><br />Such a shame<br /><br />Such a shame<br /><br /><br /><br />Down to bed as the sun goes up<br /><br />Body all in pain<br /><br />Now the swears he's going to stop<br /><br />Shooting up in vain<br /><br /><br /><br />He's doctor Jekyll and he's mr Hyde<br /><br />He's got to listen to that voice deep inside<br /><br />Got a one way ticket on a derailed train<br /><br />Got a one way ticket on a derailed train<br /><br /><br /><br />Shooting up in vain<br /><br />Such a shame<br /><br />Such a shame<br /><br /><br /><br />Got a one way ticket on a derailed train<br /><br />Go to stop shooting up in vain<br /><br />Got a one way ticket on a derailed train<br /><br /><br /><br />Got a one way ticket on a derailed train<br /><br />Go to stop shooting up in vain<br /><br />Got a one way ticket on a derailed train<br /><br /><br /><br />Got a one way ticket on a derailed train<br /><br />Go to stop shooting up in vain<br /><br />Got a one way ticket on a derailed train<br /><br /><br /><br />Got a one way ticket on a derailed train<br /><br />Go to stop shooting up in vain<br /><br />Got a one way ticket on a derailed train{% endraw %}
