(Yo Blaze you crazy for this one)  Unmovable!  Always (Ay) abounding in theâ€¦<br />Steadfast!  (All the champions out there, it feels so good)  Unmovable!  (Ay) Always abounding (I said it feels so good) in theâ€¦<br /><br />We win (we will 5x), yes sir! (we will 5x)<br />We win (we will 5x), yes sir! (we will 4x) (we gonâ€™ make it!)<br />And we win (what didnâ€™t break me made me better), yes sir!<br />(I believe that) with you by my side (together) we can touch the sky<br />See we win! (Letâ€™s go!)<br /><br />[Verse 2 - Lil Baby]<br />Striving for greatness <br />At the same time keepinâ€™ my patience<br />Canâ€™t be racing to no early grave, Iâ€™m cool with just pacing<br />I could drop at any given time,<br />Iâ€™m holdinâ€™ my aces<br />Iâ€™ve seen disappointment all in they faces<br />The turtle still cross the finish line<br />We done raised the bar so many times itâ€™s only right they give me mine<br />Diamond by myself, together we really shine<br />Long as I keep putting my faith and trust in God I know that everything will be fine<br />Built for it, real stand-up guy they ainâ€™t never breakinâ€™ my kind<br />I believe I can do anything<br />I ainâ€™t never changing my mind (Preach!)<br />Lifeâ€™s all about patience, take it one day at a time<br />Lifeâ€™s all about patience, take it one day at a time (yeah!)<br /><br />[Bridge]<br />Whatever you may be goinâ€™ through (we win!)<br />Weâ€™ll make it together, me and you (and to be clear) (we win!) (Woo!)<br />And when the clouds they wonâ€™t fade away (everybody say!)<br />Donâ€™t you give up, youâ€™re one step closer itâ€™s not the end (we gonâ€™ make it!)<br /><br />[Chorus â€“ Kirk Franklin &amp; Lil Baby]<br />We win (we will 5x), yes sir!
