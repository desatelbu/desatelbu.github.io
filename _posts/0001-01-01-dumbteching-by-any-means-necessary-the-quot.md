{% raw %}The &quot;Dumb Tech&quot; is exactly like it sounds. It's a bad idea, it'll make you take a hit or two. BUT, that doesn't mean it's completely useless. When you vault through the killer, they might be more likely to leave the pallet - which is the perfect set up for Any Means Necessary, a perk that allows you to reset pallets so they can be used to stun again.<br /><br />Is this the best build in dead by daylight? no. will it occasionally work? maybe. is a dumb tech right play for you? i don't know I'm not your doctor<br /><br />I also stream on Twitch:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/yerv">https://www.twitch.tv/yerv</a><br /><br />And I have a Twitter I guess:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/yyyerv">https://twitter.com/yyyerv</a><br /><br />Background Music<br />Down by LethalNeedle<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/zPmpVgH5udQ">https://youtu.be/zPmpVgH5udQ</a><br />LethalNeedle YT<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYazzriGjuBcy-VwvQQftZA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYazzriGjuBcy-VwvQQftZA</a>{% endraw %}
