{% raw %}Fastball- The Way (with lyrics)<br />They made up their minds<br />And they started packing<br />They left before the sun came up that day<br />An exit to eternal summer slacking<br />But where were they going Without ever knowing the way?<br />They drank up the wine<br />And they got to talking<br />They now had more important things to say<br />And when the car broke down They started walking<br />Where were they going without ever knowing the way?<br /><br /><br />Anyone could see The road that they walk on is paved in gold<br />And It's always summer, they'll never get cold<br />They'll Never get hungry<br />They'll never get old and gray<br />You can see their shadows Wandering off somewhere<br />They won't make it home<br />But they really don't care<br />They wanted the highway<br />They're happier there today , today<br /><br />The children woke up<br />And they couldn't find 'em<br />They Left before the sun came up that day<br />They just drove off<br />And left it all behind 'em<br />But Where were they going Without ever knowing the way?<br /><br />Anyone could see The road that they walk on is paved in gold<br />And It's always summer, they'll never get cold<br />They'll Never get hungry<br />They'll never get old and gray<br />You can see their shadows Wandering off somewhere<br />They Won't make it home<br />But they really don't care<br />They wanted the highway<br />They're happy there today , today <br /><br />Anyone could see The road that they walk on is paved in gold<br />And It's always summer, they'll never get cold<br />They'll Never get hungry<br />They'll never get old and gray<br />You can see their shadows Wandering off somewhere<br />They Won't make it home<br />But they really don't care<br />They wanted the highway<br />They're happy there today , today{% endraw %}
