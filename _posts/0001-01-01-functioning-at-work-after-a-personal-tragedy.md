{% raw %}Experiencing a personal tragedy is incredibly hard.  <br /><br />It’s challenging to deal with while still having to be a leader at work. <br /><br />People are depending on you, but you’re still dealing with personal pain. <br /><br />You want to grieve but you also want to be available for everybody at work. <br /><br />It’s a difficult challenge that many of us never find a way to balance. <br /><br />Sometimes, we become more focused on work than dealing with our tragedies. <br /><br />This can cost us in our personal lives. <br /><br />Sometimes, we do the complete opposite and drop everything to only focus on our personal life. <br /><br />Over time, this will lead people to believe we are not committed to work. <br /><br />So, what do you do when you're in this predicament?{% endraw %}
