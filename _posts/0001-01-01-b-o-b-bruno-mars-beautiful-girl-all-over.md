B.o.B]<br />Beautiful girls<br />All over the world<br />I could be chasin'<br />But my time would be wasted<br />They got nothin' on you, baby<br />Nothin' on you, baby<br />They might say hi<br />And I might say hey<br />But you shouldn't worry<br />About what they say<br />'Cause they got nothin' on you, baby<br />(Yeah) Nothin' on you, baby<br />Naâ€”naâ€”naâ€”nothin' on you, baby, naâ€”nothin' on you<br /><br />[Verse 1: B.o.B]<br />I know you feel where I'm comin' from<br />Regardless of the things in my past that I've done<br />Most of it really was for the hell of the fun<br />On the carousel, so around I spun<br />With no directions, just tryna get some<br />Tryna chase skirts, livin' in the summer sun<br />And so I lost more than I had ever won<br />And honestly, I ended up with none<br /><br />[Pre-Chorus 1: B.o.B]<br />There's so much nonsense, it's on my conscience<br />I'm thinkin' maybe I should get it out<br />And I don't wanna sound redundant, but I was wonderin'<br />If there was somethin' that you wanna know (That you wanna know)<br />But never mind that, we should let it go (We should let it go)<br />'Cause we don't wanna be a TV episode (TV episode)<br />And all the bad thoughts, just let 'em go<br />(Go, go, go, go)<br /><br />[Chorus 2: Bruno Mars &amp; B.o.B]<br />Beautiful girls<br />All over the world<br />I could be chasin'<br />But my time would be wasted<br />They got nothin' on you, baby<br />Naâ€”naâ€”naâ€”nothin' on you, baby, naâ€”nothin' on you<br />Nothin' on you, baby<br />Naâ€”naâ€”naâ€”nothin' on you, baby, naâ€”nothin' on you<br />They might say hi (Hi)<br />And I might say hey (Hey)<br />But you shouldn't worry<br />About what they say (Why?)<br />'Cause they got nothin' on you, baby<br />Naâ€”naâ€”naâ€”nothin' on you, baby, naâ€”nothin' on you<br />Nothin' on you, baby<br />Naâ€”naâ€”naâ€”nothin' on you, baby, naâ€”nothin' on you<br /><br />[Verse 2: B.o.B]<br />Hands down, there will never be another one<br />I been around and I never seen another one<br />Because your style they ain't really got nothin' on<br />And you wild when you ain't got nothin' on<br />Baby, you the whole package, plus you pay your taxes<br />And you keep it real while them others stay plastic<br />You're my Wonder Woman, call me Mr. Fantastic<br />Stop, now think about it<br /><br />[Pre-Chorus 2: B.o.B]<br />I've been to London (Yeah), I've been to Paris (Yeah)<br />Even way out there to Tokyo (Tokyo)<br />Back home down in Georgia (Yeah) to New Orleans (Yeah)<br />But you always steal the show (Steal the show)<br />And just like that, girl, you got me froze (Got me froze)<br />Like a Nintendo 64 (64)<br />If you never knew, well now you know<br />(Know, know, know, know)<br /><br />[Chorus 2: Bruno Mars &amp; B.o.B]<br />Beautiful girls<br />All over the world<br />I could be chasin'<br />But my time would be wasted (Ha-ha)<br />They got nothin' on you, baby<br />Naâ€”naâ€”naâ€”nothin' on you, baby, naâ€”nothin' on you<br />Nothin' on you, baby<br />Naâ€”naâ€”naâ€”nothin' on you, baby, naâ€”nothin' on you<br />They might say hi (Hi)<br />And I might say hey (Hey)<br />But you shouldn't worry<br />About what they say (Why?)<br />'Cause they got nothin' on you, baby<br />Naâ€”naâ€”naâ€”nothin' on you, baby, naâ€”nothin' on you<br />Nothin' on you, baby<br />Naâ€”naâ€”naâ€”nothin' on you, baby, naâ€”nothin' on you<br /><br />[Bridge: B.o.B]<br />Everywhere I go<br />I'm always hearin' your name<br />And no matter where I'm at<br />Girl you make me wanna sing<br />Whether a bus or a plane<br />Or a car or a train<br />No other girl's in my brain<br />And you the one to blame<br /><br />[Chorus 2: Bruno Mars &amp; B.o.B]<br />Beautiful girls<br />All over the world<br />I could be chasin'<br />But my time would be wasted (Why?)<br />They got nothin' on you, baby<br />Naâ€”naâ€”naâ€”nothin' on you, baby, naâ€”nothin' on you<br />Nothin' on you, baby<br />Naâ€”naâ€”naâ€”nothin' on you, baby, naâ€”nothin' on you<br />They might say hi (Hi)<br />And I might say hey (Hello)<br />But you shouldn't worry<br />About what they say (Why?)<br />'Cause they got nothin' on you, baby<br />Naâ€”naâ€”naâ€”nothin' on you, baby, naâ€”nothin' on you<br />Nothin' on you, baby<br />Naâ€”naâ€”naâ€”nothin' on you, baby, naâ€”nothin' on you<br /><br />[Outro: B.o.B]<br />Yeah, and that's just how we do it<br />Heheheh, and I'ma let this ride<br />B.o.B and Bruno Mars<br /><br />#nothingonyou #tiktok{% endraw %}
