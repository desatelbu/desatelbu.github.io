{% raw %}Yuriy Kasyanov, volunteer and blogger in Shuster Live: “This is a trial of Maidan because all the perpetrators except for Yanukovych can be questioned. All of them run the government and do the same what they did while Yanukovych ruled. This does not necessarily make Yanukovych a witness to punish that one who shot the people. One boss is gone but the system is the same. the Maidan ended in defeat. Let’s accept  it.{% endraw %}
