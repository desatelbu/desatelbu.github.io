{% raw %}We have teamed up with Sway Energy for 'Party Lines,' presenting an all-new competition format: Four teams each have 24 hours to get their best clips at The Berrics. The teams will be judged on creativity and style, and there's a $5,000 cash prize on the line for the winning crew! First up, we have Monica Torres, Ivan Monteiro, Filipe Mota, and Iago Carrasco, filmed and edited by Ricardo Rivera.<br /><br />Subscribe to The Berrics: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/TheBerricsYoutube">http://bit.ly/TheBerricsYoutube</a><br /><br />The Berrics was founded by professional skateboarders Steve Berra and Eric Koston in December of 2007.
