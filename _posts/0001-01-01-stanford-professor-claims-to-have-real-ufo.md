{% raw %}Dr. Garry Nolan is the Rachford and Carlota A. Harris Professor in the Department of Pathology at Stanford University School of Medicine. He has published over 300 research articles and is the holder of 40 US patents, and has been honored as one of the top 25 inventors at Stanford University. Dr. Nolan was the founder of Rigel Inc. (NASDAQ: RIGL), and Nodality, Inc. (a diagnostics development company), BINA (a genomics computational infrastructure company sold to Roche Diagnostics), Founder of Apprise (sold to Roche Sequencing Solutions), co-Founder of Ionpath and co-Founder of Akoya.<br />But in this conversation, we focus on his interest in the area of UFO’s. Since 2016, Garry has been in possession of and analyzing materials given to him by some of the top “Ufoologists” in the country like Jacque Vallee. He’s also consulted for the CIA in studying the brain structures of people who claim UFO encounters. In this interview, we discuss his very interesting findings on both UFO materials and brain structures.  Spoiler alert: the materials contain isotope ratios not naturally occurring anywhere on earth, and the brain structures are very unique.
