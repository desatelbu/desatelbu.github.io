{% raw %}I swear, there was more than 500 requests for this one.. but here it is!<br />Download:<br />►iTunes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/LcW6zI">https://goo.gl/LcW6zI</a><br />►Amazon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/xj1ONn">https://goo.gl/xj1ONn</a><br />►Google Play: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/Jt0sO5">https://goo.gl/Jt0sO5</a><br />►Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/pZzyXa">https://goo.gl/pZzyXa</a><br /><br />Here we are. The trilogy has been completed. And what better way to finish it off than with an epic orchestral arrangement along with a proper animation!<br /><br />Before anything else, I should address something. The writer of these lyrics (ateotu) has stated that this isn't meant to be from Frisk's perspective, but rather the player's. But, since the majority of the Undertale fanbase seem to call these lyrics &quot;Frisk's response&quot;, I have decided to keep the &quot;Frisk version&quot; in the title to avoid confusing people who don't know who's perspective it's really from.<br /><br />I had a ton of help this time from my good friend Cloudjumper. He did the majority of the orchestral arrangement as well as mixing all the instruments while I handled the vocal mixing and mastering. He's a super talented dude and you should definitively check out his music. It's crazy good!<br /><br />Secondly, I'd like to thank Olivia (XxMileikaIvanaxX) who returns as this illustrator for this remix. Seriously, the video wouldn't even be 80% as pretty and full of emotion if it weren't for her absolutely incredible illustrations. Thank you agreeing to work with me again! Please check out her DeviantArt page for more amazing artwork!<br /><br />And lastly I'd like to thank my wonderful friend (and #1 princess of the world) Mom0ki for lending me her angelic voice for this project. After hearing the finished product with her voice, I really can't imagine it being any other way. It was meant to be sung by her. Please check out her channel for amazing song covers as well as comic dubs!<br /><br />And finally, I'd like to thank everyone who subscribed to my channel and stuck around. You guys are amazing and I can't thank you enough for your patience. I hope you'll decide to keep supporting my music even if it's not Undertale related.<br /><br />With all that, please enjoy the final entry in this &quot;Stronger Than You Remix Trilogy&quot; for Undertale!<br /><br />Come say hi!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/DatXandu">https://twitter.com/DatXandu</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://ask.fm/DatXandu">http://ask.fm/DatXandu</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/xanduisbored">https://soundcloud.com/xanduisbored</a><br /><br />--CREDITS--<br />Vocal mixing, mastering &amp; video: Xandu<br />Arrangement &amp; mixing: Cloudjumper<br />(<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Cloudjumper)">https://www.youtube.com/c/Cloudjumper)</a><br />Vocals: Mom0ki<br />(<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/MOM0KI)">https://www.youtube.com/MOM0KI)</a><br />Illustration: XxMileikaIvanaxX<br />(<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://xxmileikaivanaxx.deviantart.com/)">http://xxmileikaivanaxx.deviantart.com/)</a><br />Lyrics: ateotu<br />(<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ateotu)">https://www.youtube.com/user/ateotu)</a><br />Song originally from: Steven Universe{% endraw %}
