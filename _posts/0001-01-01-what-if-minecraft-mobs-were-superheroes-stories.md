{% raw %}With the Allay having won the Minecraft Mob Vote 2021, and just with the vote having happened in general, I've been getting a lot of requests lately to do another Minecraft episode. Plus probably because Mojang recently announced the Minecraft 1.19 update, that probably spawned requests too.<br /><br />Whatever the reason, I was happy to do another one! I did consider doing another round of Mobs as FantasyMonsters but figured it would be fun to try something else. And so, here we are, an episode turning Mobs into Superheroes in the same universe as my SCP Superhero episodes! In this ep I take the Allay, the Warden, The Ravager and the Blaze and draw and write stories for all of them as superheroes in the city of Craftopolis!<br /><br />Hope you all enjoy the comic-inspired origins for these heroes, and of course their designs, in: What if MINECRAFT MOBS Were SUPERHEROES?!
