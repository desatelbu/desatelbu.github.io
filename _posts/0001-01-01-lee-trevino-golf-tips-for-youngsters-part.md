{% raw %}1988 Lee Trevino Golf Tips for Youngsters - Part 3 - Completion of the Golf Swing<br />In Part 3 Lee Trevino describes what starts the downswing as well as the importance of the back of the left hand and clubface alignment. <br />There is some real gold here. Along with what Lee describes in this segment, in his 1976 book &quot;Groove Your Golf Swing My Way&quot; on page 119  he describes the shift in the transition to the downswing: &quot;You should feel as if you're shifting your weight from the inside of your right foot toward the outside ball of your left foot.&quot;<br />My interpretation is to feel like you are stepping into a throw.<br /><br />Enjoy!{% endraw %}
