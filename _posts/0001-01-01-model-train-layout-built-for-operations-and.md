{% raw %}Episode 18 of season 2021 on the new HO Scale Union Pacific Railroad Evanston Subdivision; an N scale inspired HO layout. The layout is being built by Daryl Kruse, an experience modeler with articles in many national model train publications.  The UPRR Evanston Subdivision covers the original UP mainline from Green River, WY to Ogden, UT.  The layout will be a great railfan layout, but will also include lots of yard operations, local switching and MOW activity.  <br />   You may purchase items from the N scale layout at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://uprr-geneva-sub.square.site/">https://uprr-geneva-sub.square.site/</a><br />   This episode features the additional painting of the ceiling in preparation for extending the benchwork and mainline to the Holcim Cement Area.  s2021e18{% endraw %}
