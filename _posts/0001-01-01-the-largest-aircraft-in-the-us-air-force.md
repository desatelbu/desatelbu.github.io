{% raw %}C-5M Super Galaxy military aircraft in action, the largest aircraft in the US Air Force. The Lockheed C-5 Super Galaxy is a large military transport aircraft designed and built by Lockheed, and now maintained and upgraded by its successor, Lockheed Martin. It provides the United States Air Force (USAF) with a heavy intercontinental-range strategic airlift capability, one that can carry outsized and oversized loads, including all air-certifiable cargo. The C-5 Super Galaxy has many similarities to the smaller Lockheed C-141 Starlifter and the later Boeing C-17 Globemaster III. The C-5 Super Galaxy is among the largest military aircraft in the world.<br /><br />[Featured Videos]<br />C-5M Super Galaxy Aircraft Cargo Loading Training, The Largest Plane In The U.S. Air Force<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/PQ_MtTCBKdI">https://youtu.be/PQ_MtTCBKdI</a><br /><br />Antonov An-225 Mriya Landing at Leipzig, Germany – The World's Largest Cargo Plane<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/RfAwo8y87BA">https://youtu.be/RfAwo8y87BA</a><br /><br />US President Arrives at the 171st Air Refueling Wing aboard Air Force One, Boeing 747 Aircraft<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/6HTjZ_-zE64">https://youtu.be/6HTjZ_-zE64</a><br /><br />B-52 Stratofortress Take Off U.S. Air Force<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/RJzFICvJhGQ">https://youtu.be/RJzFICvJhGQ</a><br /><br />Paratroopers Jump from C-17 Globemaster III Aircraft • Female Airborne Operations<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/zT1qoFNqWTY">https://youtu.be/zT1qoFNqWTY</a><br /><br />U.S. Air Force, United States Department of Defense, Motorizado{% endraw %}
