{% raw %}TOM BRADY APPEARS TO CUSS OUT SAINTS COACH ... 'Go F*** Yourself'<br /><br />The T in TB12 now stands for temper ... 'cause Tom Brady completely lost his cool during a bad loss to the Saints on Sunday -- appearing to tell New Orleans coach Dennis Allen to &quot;go f*** yourself.&quot;<br /><br />It was a rough night for Tom Brady in Tampa Bay -- the Bucs fell 9-0 in a blowout loss to New Orleans ... and things came to a head when the 7-time Super Bowl champ threw an interception to C.J. Gardner-Johnson in the 4th quarter.<br />After the pick, many believe Brady ran over to Allen -- who stepped up after HC Sean Payton tested positive for COVID-19 -- and cussed him out.<br /><br />The interaction was caught on video ... and naturally, every amateur lipreader on social media came up with the same conclusion.<br />Brady, who got shut out for just the third time in his career, did not have a good game against the Saints. His passes weren't hitting their targets, he lost his three best pass catchers, and he kept getting knocked around. The Saints' defense was masterful, keeping the pressure on Brady all night. <br />In the fourth quarter, right after he threw an interception to C.J. Gardner-Johnson, his anger bubbled over. Running past the Saints sideline, Brady appeared to yell &quot;go f*** yourself&quot; right in the face of defensive line coach Ryan Nielsen. The analysis from amateur lip-readers is far from an official transcript, but it's hard to imagine what else he could be saying with his mouth moving in that particular way. <br /><br />But, that wasn't the only outburst of the night -- Brady got so pissed later in the 4th quarter that he chucked his Microsoft Surface on the sideline ... completely wrecking it in the process.<br /><br />The frustrations have been piling on in recent years ... as Tom can't seem to figure out how to beat the Saints in the regular season since joining the Bucs.<br />“Didn’t do much of anything right,” Brady said after being shut out for the first time in 15 years — ending his streak at 255 consecutive starts (including playoff games).<br />“I wish it was just one thing. It was a lot of things,” he said. “We just didn’t play well enough. We’re not going to win scoring no points.”{% endraw %}
