{% raw %}9 year old Erin Wilson shared memories of her Grandad, John, with us after he died at Coventry Myton Hospice.<br /><br /> <br /><br />    We used to go out on sunny days to the park and he’d push me on the swings and he used to always fall asleep when we’d watch movies, even at the cinema! I used to carry his tea and toast for him because his hands shook and he’d spill it otherwise. I never wanted to leave his side. One Christmas I was given a makeup set and he let me do his makeup – eyeshadow and blusher and lipstick! I look at my snakes n’ ladders game every day because that’s what me and Grandad used to play.<br /><br />    Grandad was 80 when he died; His birthday is Valentine’s Day and I still buy him a balloon every birthday and let it float into the sky so he can catch it! I was really upset when my Dad told me Grandad died. Now I’m happier though because he’s in a happier place now. It’s been a very hard experience with my Grandad not being here. I was crying every time I went to school, and we made Valentine’s cards at school which upset me but everyone on my table came around me to hug me and make me feel better.<br /><br />    I came to see Rosemary at Warwick Myton Hospice for counselling and I’ve got lots of things which I made with her like a memory box, salt jar, hedgehog and a canvas to remember him. I’ve told my friends all about coming to Rainbow Ripples and all the stuff I’ve made. I felt much better after having counselling with Rosemary – all of my sadness has gone and all of the happiness about my Grandad has come back. Me and nan still share memories about Grandad.<br /><br />Erin very bravely talked about her Grandad to other children who have used our Rainbow Ripples service, at their very own Light up a Life remembrance event at Coventry Myton Hospice.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Counselling helped Erin to find the happiness in remembering her Grandad, despite being sad about his death. By supporting The Myton Hospices, you can make a difference to a child who has lost a loved one.{% endraw %}
