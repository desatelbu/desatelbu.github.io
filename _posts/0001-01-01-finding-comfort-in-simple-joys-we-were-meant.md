{% raw %}Hello, friends üíõ<br /><br />The seasons are changing. <br />As Fall fades to winter and daylight hours dwindle‚Ä¶I often feel panic. Seasonal depression is right around the corner. This winter is going to be different though! I am going to ENJOY this winter.<br /><br />It is crucial to carve out time in our weeks for ourselves. If we do not prioritize our well-being, we cannot fully show up for those we care about, fulfill our responsibilities, or live a wholehearted life. When we take care of ourselves, every single other person in our life benefits.<br /><br />So here's to slowing down, romanticizing life's simple joys, and embracing the coziness of the darker months ‚ú®<br /><br />Thank you always for being here, friends ‚ù§Ô∏è<br /><br />BIG hugs, <br />Morgan<br /><br />The books that taught me about slow living and hygge:<br /><br />&quot;Seeking Slow, Reclaim Moments of Calm in Your Day&quot; by Melanie Barnes<br />&quot;The Book of Hygge, the Danish Art of Contentment, Comfort, and Connection&quot; by Louisa Thomsen Brits<br /><br />‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®<br /><br />Care to join me for even more cozy content? üçÅ Join my Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/morganlong?fan_landing=true">https://www.patreon.com/morganlong?fan_landing=true</a><br /><br />I get all of the music I use in my videos from: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/yhbsw3/">https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/yhbsw3/</a><br /><br />üì∫ My Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/thenamesmorganlong/">https://www.instagram.com/thenamesmorganlong/</a><br /><br />üéß My Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/user/morganelizlong?si=pindsj2iTD6qavPsufqOkg">https://open.spotify.com/user/morganelizlong?si=pindsj2iTD6qavPsufqOkg</a>{% endraw %}
