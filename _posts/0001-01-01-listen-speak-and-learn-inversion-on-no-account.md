{% raw %}Inversion is the reversal of the normal word order in a sentence or phrase. <br />There are two types of inversion:<br />1. Subject-verb inversion, where the subject and the main verb switch positions and the word order becomes verb + subject: On the top of the hill stood an old oak tree.<br />2. Subject-auxiliary inversion, where the subject and the auxiliary switch positions and the word order becomes auxiliary + subject (+ verb): Hardly had I arrived home when my phone rang.<br />Inversion happens in English for emphasis, dramatic purpose or formality. <br />The second type of inversion uses negative and limiting adverbs - these are a group of adverbs which limit the meaning of a verb or make it negative. Examples are never, hardly, no, only, little, nor, scarcely, etc. <br />Inversion  is used  to give emphasis or to  be rhetorical  in more formal situation,  in  political  speech,  on  the  news,  and  also  in literature.<br />Some native  speakers may also  use them occasionally in day-to-day conversation.{% endraw %}
