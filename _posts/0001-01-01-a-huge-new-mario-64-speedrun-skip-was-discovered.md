{% raw %}Despite Super Mario 64 speedrunning routes being very optimized, we are still discovering more ways to beat the game with 120 stars quicker. Today I'll be covering the new 100 coin route in HMC and discuss how much the HMC 100 coin strat saves time, is it RTA viable, and how risky it is. Hope you enjoy!<br /><br />Shoutouts to Salt &amp; Ginger for discovering this strat! ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/SaltAndGinger64">https://twitter.com/SaltAndGinger64</a><br /><br />merch ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://simply64store.com/">https://simply64store.com/</a><br />twitch ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitch.tv/simply">https://twitch.tv/simply</a><br />twitter ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/SIMPLYN64">https://www.twitter.com/SIMPLYN64</a><br />soundcloud ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/simply64">https://soundcloud.com/simply64</a><br /><br />Edited by oknem<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/theoknem">https://twitter.com/theoknem</a><br /><br />OUTRO SONG ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/simply64/tits-4-bits-prod-giovanni">https://soundcloud.com/simply64/tits-4-bits-prod-giovanni</a><br /><br />Simply discusses new Super Mario 64 strategies, particularly the Hazy Maze Cave 100 coin strategy for 120 star speedruns. Its honestly crazy how much time save the Mario 64 community is finding in 2021. With Twitch streamers such as Emiru and Mizkif speedrunning SM64 on their streams, hopefully more searching will be done to  find even more SM64 strategies. If you combine framewalk, chip clip, and the HMC 100 coin strategy, the Mario speedrunning community has found so much new routes. This past couple months has been interesting for Mario, as we have had a new World Record in 16 stars, 70 stars, and 120 stars. Can't wait to see the future of Super Mario 64 speedrunning!{% endraw %}
