Some of these secrets and tips, I didn’t pick up necessarily in option and stock trading. I picked them up in other businesses I owned or from other successful business owners I had the privilege of strategizing with. However, I realized that the advice fit perfectly into the formula of what it has taken for me to become a successful option and stock trader! So here we go in no particular order.<br /><br />Happy investing!<br />Randy Perez<br /><br />#optionstradingcoach #tradingcoach #tradingmentor<br /><br />Disclaimer: I am not a financial planner and am not offering investment advice.
