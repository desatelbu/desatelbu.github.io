{% raw %}US Air Force pilot Mike Couillard takes his ten-year-old son Matthew skiing in Turkey. Losing the trail in a freak snowstorm they wander blindly into the wilderness. Tired, cold and hungry, they find a cave to shelter for the night. Days pass with no sign of rescue, despite a massive search operation. Back home Mike's wife and other children wait, praying.

Two days later, he's discovered by passing woodcutters who he directs to the cave. <br /><br />Don't forgot to subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2Bf13bm">https://bit.ly/2Bf13bm</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Welcome to Fresh Lifestyle! 👏👨‍⚕️🍎<br /><br /><br /><br />The brand new lifestyle YouTube Channel!
