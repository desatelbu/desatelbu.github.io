{% raw %}In a scene saturated by kick drums and synthesisers, there’s a voice in electronic music that really stands out: Alan Abrahams. Born in South Africa and growing up in Cape Town, his music as Portable first surfaced during the early-2000s.<br /><br />As Bodycode, however, a more dance-oriented project linked to the soul of Portable’s music, Abrahams’ style brings together the indigenous sounds of his youth with his love for the proto-futuristic form of ‘90s Chicago house.{% endraw %}
