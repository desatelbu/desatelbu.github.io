{% raw %}Washington Post journalist Jason Rezaian talks with Tommy Vietor about his new podcast 544 Days, which details his time being held hostage in Iran’s notorious Evin prison through conversations with family, politicians, and the late Anthony Bourdain.<br /><br />To listen to Jason's 544 Days Series head to: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://crooked.com/podcast-series/544-days/">https://crooked.com/podcast-series/544-days/</a><br /><br />Subscribe to our channel! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/crookedmedia?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/crookedmedia?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.<br /><br />Want some pep talks, the most important things to do/know, and the occasional dog pic?
