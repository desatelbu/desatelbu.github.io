Get to know Tiny and his clay friends through their hilarious daily situations such as their love life, pranks, etc. <br /><br />✨ Clay Mixer is a claymation channel in which each animated piece, either character or background, is handmade and &quot;deformable&quot;. <br /><br />🤩 Tiny - the leading character, is named after his small stature. He is a blue-skinned guy who has a playful, mischievous, and funny personality. In each episode, Tiny transforms into various persons with different lives and fates. No matter what the circumstances are, he always has unexpected and humorous solutions that truly entertain the audience. <br /><br />🔥 In addition, other clay characters also own distinctive traits that contribute to the diversity of the Clay Mixer world: lovely Pinky, tricksy Alien, hot-tempered Chunky, coward Nerdy, and naughty Violet. <br /><br />😊 The journeys of Tiny bring not only laughter but also meaningful lessons which take audiences from one surprise to another. <br /><br />😊 7 days per week, Tiny appears again to tell the audience the stories.<br /><br />Disclaimer                                                                                                                                                                                               <br />►The contents are intended for the audience aged 13-30 years.
