{% raw %}In this fun application of both the intermediate and mean value theorems, I show that a function f from [0,1] to [0,1] with f'(x) never being equal to 1 has exactly one fixed point, in other words the equation f(x) = x has exactly one solution. Then I present some real-life applications of that theorem. Enjoy!{% endraw %}
