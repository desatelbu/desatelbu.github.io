{% raw %}Today AWP began our search for 72-year-old Vietnam Veteran Thomas Thornton who was last seen on March 25th, 2021 with a last cell phone pin in Huxley, Texas.<br /><br />Thomas and his 2017 dark grey Ford Edge SUV was spotted on surveillance cameras at Hemphill Fuel on March 24th.<br /><br />Identifying a long road that ended directly into the water near Huxley Bay Boat Ramp led AWP to start their search at the end of the road at 9:00 A.M. this morning. <br /><br />By 9:12 A.M. Jared and Jeremy identified a target in the shape of a car, marked it with a magnet with Jacob and Doug diving on it shortly after. <br /><br />A phone call was placed to 911 at 10:05 A.M. letting the Shelby County Sheriff's Office know that we had dove on our target, found a Ford Edge, pulling the license plate #NJJ8580.<br /><br />Visibility was less than 6 inches. <br /><br />Thomas' 2 sisters and nephew arrived around 9:15 A.M. this morning and were on scene, being notified of the matching license plate prior to the 911 call. <br /><br />Without the county having a dive team, AWP was responsible for the vehicle recovery. <br /><br />Once on shore, the driver's side windows were broken out to identify and confirm that Thomas was inside. <br /><br />A full autopsy will need to be conducted before the final confirmation<br /><br />The Shelby County Sheriff's Office was very cordial and great to work with, sharing their appreciation of our efforts to bring closure to the Thornton family. <br /><br />It is our honor to have brought Thomas home for a proper Military Burial. <br /><br />Our thoughts and prays go out to Thomas' family during this difficult time. <br /><br />We will have a full edit of our search and recovery efforts available in the next few months. <br /><br />Hug the ones you love for you never know when it might be the last time you see them. <br /><br />We are humbled by the opportunity all of you have given us to help in the search for answers as to what happened to Thomas.<br /><br />HOW CAN YOU HELP AWP?<br />========<br />üéØ Subscribe to AWP (It's Free)...‚û§ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/SubAWP">http://bit.ly/SubAWP</a><br />üëï AWP Merch and Donations..‚û§ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://adventureswithpurpose.com">https://adventureswithpurpose.com</a><br />üé¨ GET VIDEOS EARLY (Become a Member)... ‚û§ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/AWP-Team-Member">http://bit.ly/AWP-Team-Member</a><br /><br />HOW IS AWP FUNDED?... ‚û§ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/wz1dCguO2y0">https://youtu.be/wz1dCguO2y0</a><br /><br />SUBSCRIBE TO OTHERS ON THE TEAM<br />‚òû Subscribe to Doug..‚û§ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/DougBishop">http://bit.ly/DougBishop</a><br />‚òû Sub to Josh..‚û§ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/SubJoshCantu">https://bit.ly/SubJoshCantu</a><br />‚òû Carson on Instagram..‚û§ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/CarsonOnInstagram">https://bit.ly/CarsonOnInstagram</a><br />‚òû Subscribe to Jacob's Channel..‚û§ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/SubChaosDivers">http://bit.ly/SubChaosDivers</a><br />‚òû Depths of History..‚û§ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/SubToBritian">https://bit.ly/SubToBritian</a><br />‚òû Subscribe to Nug..‚û§  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/SubExploringWithNUG">https://bit.ly/SubExploringWithNUG</a><br />‚òû Subscribe to Adam Brown..‚û§ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/AdamBrownAdventures">http://bit.ly/AdamBrownAdventures</a><br /><br />Questions?<br />Email: support@adventureswithpurpose.com<br />==================<br /><br />The AWP Movement would not be possible without your support, helping us travel the US offering our services for FREE to families searching for their lost loved ones...
