{% raw %}Learn: The Quick &amp; easy way on How To Build An Effective Data Tables In Excel │ What-If-Analysis  │ Single Variable<br /><br />In this video, you will learn: <br />1. How To Build An Effective Data Tables In Excel │ What-If-Analysis  │ Single Variable<br />2. Data Tables in Excel <br /><br />In my last video tutorial, we took a bit further on the excel solver tool in solving another optimization problem using linear Programming which helps to solve more complex decision-making problems.<br /><br />In today’s video tutorial, we’re going to take a look at another one inside of Microsoft excel called DATA TABLES in which I am going to show you How To Build An Effective Data Tables In Excel │ What-If-Analysis │ Single Variable.<br />Microsoft Excel is full of So many different powerful robust tools. The goal seek and Excel solver tool. We have done just two of these during my last video tutorial<br />Data tables are one of the existing parts of What-If-Analysis tools, which allow you to observe your result by experimenting it with different alternative values of variables and comparing the outcomes stored by the data table<br />Microsoft Excel through the use of a data table, we’ll essentially take these alternatives and stick them into the formula by recalculating it for us. <br /><br />Inside Excel, there are two (2) different types of data tables; there’s a single variable data table which means, you've got a single set of alternatives. Or a Two-variable data table where you can do two different sets of alternative values into a formula. <br />The example that I have here is a single variable data table. Now with a single variable data table, it has to be set up in a very speciﬁc way. The very ﬁrst column in the table has to be your list of alternative values in our case, it's this percentage rate. The second column and the very ﬁrst row is where your formula, your original formula is going to be placed. And below it is where it cell will recalculate all for you automatically based on these alternatives and that original. All right. <br />So my ﬁrst step I got the table set up. <br /><br />In my second step, I want to know what my monthly payment is going to be based on these three values, 400, 000, 4% and 340 Equals payment Using PMT Function to calculate Monthly Payment. This has been treated inside Excel Goal Seek class in my previous video tutorial<br />……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………….<br />Share this video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/i79FrzjPq58">https://youtu.be/i79FrzjPq58</a><br /><br />For more simple and easy to follow How-to videos,<br /><br />Click the Link Below to subscribe:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLkpSbJ_z3jtZixM2rga7PA?view_as=subscriber">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLkpSbJ_z3jtZixM2rga7PA?view_as=subscriber</a><br /><br />Join this channel to get access to perks:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLkpSbJ_z3jtZixM2rga7PA/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLkpSbJ_z3jtZixM2rga7PA/join</a><br /><br />#Exceldatabase  #Data  #Table  #What-If-Analysis<br /><br />LearnexcelwithT{% endraw %}
