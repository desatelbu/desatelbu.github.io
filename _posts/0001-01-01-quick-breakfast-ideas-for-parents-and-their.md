{% raw %}Brilliant breakfast ideas for your family <br /><br />Hello, moms and dads :) If you don’t know what to cook for your kids, here is an awesome guide for you! Most of these recipes are super easy to cook, and even your children can make them. Put some berries and fruit into a small yogurt pack, put a lollipop in it, and freeze everything. You will get a healthy version of ice cream with a surprise inside ;) If your kids love trying new things, let them cook with you. You can make a super simple watermelon cake and add different fruits, berries, a syrup on top of it. Let your kids feel like they’re participating in a popular cooking show and help them boost their creativity and cooking skills! Stay tuned to see how you can make fried apple donuts, fast food out of fruit, chocolate Pop-it bars, rainbow cakes, and more unique recipes to surprise your kids. Most ingredients for these excellent dishes are really simple. For example, the only unusual ingredients you will need for rainbow pancakes are food dyes. We will also show you a lot of recipes with eggs, cheese, sausage, and veggies that are nourishing and yummy at the same time. <br /><br />TIMESTAMPS: <br />00:37 — Fruit fast food <br />00:56 — Banana dessert <br />02:01 — Watermelon cake <br />02:43 — Rainbow pancakes<br /><br />This video is made for entertainment purposes.
