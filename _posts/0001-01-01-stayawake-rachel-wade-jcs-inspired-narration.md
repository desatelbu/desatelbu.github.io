{% raw %}This is a Re-release of Episode six of STAYAWAKE!<br /><br />I received a lot of comments regarding the first few minutes of this episode being slightly confusing and hard to follow, so I am re-uploading this episode to remedy any of the narrative issues while also making any corrections that were addressed since my previous release.<br /><br />Additional information regarding the history of this love triangle: (as quoted)<br /><br />&quot;Rachel Wade and Sarah Ludemann were romantic rivals who were competing for the affections of Wade's ex-boyfriend, Joshua Camacho. In the first six months of Ludemann's relationship with Camacho, police officers spoke to Wade six times regarding public confrontations with him. Wade also got into a verbal argument with the mother of Camacho's child. Camacho exhibited domestic violence against Ludemann, whom he punched in the face, but Ludemann did not press charges.<br /><br />Wade left insulting voicemails for Ludemann. Their rivalry quickly turned violent. They began to harass one another, and according to Wade, Ludemann would show up at an Applebee's where Wade worked in order to taunt her. During one incident, Ludemann told police that Wade repeatedly called her cell phone and left threatening voicemails.&quot;<br /><br />For an expanded definition of homicide - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/homicide">https://www.britannica.com/topic/homicide</a><br /><br />**Corrections**<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />How do you feel about this case?
