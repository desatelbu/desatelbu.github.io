{% raw %}This may sound like something super simple but implementing these surf tips will improve your surfing. <br />I believe the take off and pop-up are the most important factors to getting the most out of any wave, especially faster waves.<br />I hope this episode helps!  Thanks for watching.  I'm Brad Jacobson and I'll see you on the sand. <br />Music: Vendla{% endraw %}
