{% raw %}This Is The US New Gigantic Aircraft Carrier Shocked The World.<br /> In the early 2000s, the United States government decided its current fleet of aircraft carriers were not going to be up to the task of defending American interests overseas in the decades to come.<br /><br />They wanted a carrier fleet that would be faster, bigger, that would be capable of launching and receiving hundreds and ultimately thousands of aircraft every single day, no matter which direction the wind was blowing, once all the new ships had been deployed. They wanted more advanced systems to detect and destroy the enemy faster.<br /><br />The new design would use less crewmen and incorporate significantly better survivability systems with less maintenance and ultimately a much more reduced lifespan cost than the Nimitz class it would be replacing.<br /><br /><br />#US #new #gigantic #aircraft #carrier #shocked #world #USS #GeraldRFord<br /><br /><br />For copyright matters please contact us at:<br />jad71064223@gmail.com{% endraw %}
