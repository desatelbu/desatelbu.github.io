Sit back enjoy and pick your level of chill.<br /><br />“Surest” is a feel good track with its laid back soulful flow that will make you say pffffff!!!! skip spring where’s summer at?, giving you inspiring thoughts of summertime road trips, parties, beaches, sunsets and sunrises.<br /><br />These two gifted producers Western Sea and Cnof will have you like Arnold in “Total Recall” – your mind taken elsewhere. They have brought us a fresh, feel good, smooth, soulful, liquid funk DnB EP that shows us what great collaboration sounds like…only one word sums it up, DOPE!!!!{% endraw %}
