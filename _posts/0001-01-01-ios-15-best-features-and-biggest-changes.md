I've been testing iOS 15’s new features, and everything from bigger additions like FaceTime call weblinks for friends on Android and Windows to smaller changes like pinning conversations to the top of the Messages app have improved my iPhone without disrupting my daily status quo.<br /><br />02:52 - Focus<br />04:15 - Portrait Mode for FaceTime<br />04:50 - Notification Summary<br />05:40 - Live Text<br />06:18 - Features missing at launch<br /><br />Subscribe to CNET: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/CNETTV">https://www.youtube.com/user/CNETTV</a><br />Like us on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/cnet">https://www.facebook.com/cnet</a><br />Follow us on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/cnet">https://www.twitter.com/cnet</a><br />Follow us on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2icCYYm">http://bit.ly/2icCYYm</a><br />Follow us on TikTok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMd2h6yac/">https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMd2h6yac/</a>{% endraw %}
