{% raw %}NATO was involved in the Bosnian war almost from the beginning. First by taking part in UN airlift to the besieged citizens of Sarajevo, and later within its own Operation Deny Flight and Deliberate Force. <br />This involvement wasn't without risk and NATO nations indeed lost several military aircraft in the skies of Bosnia. In the first part, we will cover the first two cases. An Italian Air Force G222 and a Royal Navy Sea Harrier.<br />Like usually, some assets needed to be approximated by similar ones due to the limited availability in DCS World. <br /><br />Sources:<br />- Aviation Safety Network<br />  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19920903-0">https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19920903-0</a><br />- Guerre: Bosnia 1992, quellâ€™aereo italiano abbattuto nei cieli di Sarajevo<br />  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.forzearmate.org/guerre-bosnia-1992-quellaereo-italiano-abbattuto-nei-cieli-di-sarajevo/">https://www.forzearmate.org/guerre-bosnia-1992-quellaereo-italiano-abbattuto-nei-cieli-di-sarajevo/</a><br />- Bosnian Thunder - Accident above Herzegovina<br />  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www2.scc.rutgers.edu/serbiandigest/50/t50-1.htm">http://www2.scc.rutgers.edu/serbiandigest/50/t50-1.htm</a><br />- Nick Richardson - No Escape Zone<br />  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/No-Escape-Zone-Story-Journey/dp/0751531022">https://www.amazon.com/No-Escape-Zone-Story-Journey/dp/0751531022</a><br />- Harrier pilot safe<br />  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/harrier-pilot-safe-1370719.html">https://www.independent.co.uk/news/harrier-pilot-safe-1370719.html</a><br />- Keeping watch off a burning shore<br />  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://iainballantyne.com/keeping-watch-off-a-burning-shore/">http://iainballantyne.com/keeping-watch-off-a-burning-shore/</a><br /><br />Support us on Patreon:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/showtime112">https://www.patreon.com/showtime112</a><br /><br />#MilitaryAviationHistory #DCSWorldHistoricalReenactment{% endraw %}
