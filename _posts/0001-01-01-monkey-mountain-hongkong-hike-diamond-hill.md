{% raw %}For those of us who love to walk on the wild side, Kam Shan Country Park — better known as Monkey Mountain— is the perfect destination. Home to 2,000 macaques, this hidden gem in northern Kowloon is perfect for animal lovers and nature enthusiasts alike.<br /><br />Not so fussed about the wildlife? No problem! The sprawling park has multiple hiking and walking trails passing by Kowloon Reservoir and Shek Lei Pui Reservoir and is awash with historical military sites such as Smugglers’ Pass and Gin Drinker’s Line (though we’d recommend bringing water with you instead!). You’re also close to several barbecue areas and serene picnic sites on Cheung Yuen Road and Golden Hill Road, surrounded by lush greenery and plenty of lookout spots to take in the views of Lion’s Rock<br /><br />Diamond Hill<br />Diamond Hill is a hill in the east of Kowloon, Hong Kong. The name also refers to the area on or adjacent to the hill. It is surrounded by Ngau Chi Wan, San Po Kong, Wong Tai Sin and Tsz Wan Shan. Its northeast is limited by the ridge.
