We focus on bringing you high-quality and well-edited New World highlights &amp; funny moments. Our dedicated team of highly-skilled video editors add transformative edits to each clip including subtitles, zooms, crops, music and speed adjustments. While we mainly focus on highlights, our New World videos also provide you with the latest New World news including New World updates, New World patches and New World PvP content.<br /><br />When it comes to our videos, we like to do things differently compared to other highlight channels. First off, our host Dom commentates over the Warzone clips in every video. Commentary allows us to add value by making observations or giving pointers that will help YOU improve your gameplay or give you a better understanding of what‚Äôs going on in each clip.{% endraw %}
