{% raw %}Considered the D.B. Cooper of NASCAR, L.W. Wright ran one Cup Race at Talladega Superspeedway before vanishing without a trace. 40 Years later I believe I have finally made a big step in finding out who L.W. Wright was and what his past was like. <br /><br />Thanks For Watching<br /><br />Credit to NASCAR for footage and photos<br /><br />Thanks to all the sources that helped make this video possible.{% endraw %}
