{% raw %}#nuthouse #endupinlunaticasylum #wnewsvideo<br /><br />After our wedding we had to move in with my mother-in-law as we still had to save up money to buy our own house. My “second mother” immediately disliked me…  Every day she never missed a chance to tell me that my stay there would be very brief and she’d find a way to get rid of me.<br /><br />It was obvious why she was doing that: my mother-in-law dreamed of having my husband, her precious boy, marry another woman, and I spoiled her plans. But he and I loved each other and it seemed like nothing would separate us…<br /><br />But soon my mother-in-law turned into a different person: she became caring and kind.  She started giving me some infusions she was making, claiming they were good for my immunity… I gratefully accepted all of them; little did I know that that was a huge mistake!<br /><br />Because her feigned care caused me to end up in a nuthouse!{% endraw %}
