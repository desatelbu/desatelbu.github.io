Even tho this level may not look like much... it may just look like a random level you'd find in the magic tab... but this level has been my project for 3+ years and I am incredibly proud of it! I am so thankful for everyone who helped work on this years ago!<br /><br />I really wanna shoutout a few friends of mine cause I think they could use some more attention!<br /><br />Vaen: A really insane player that just recently beat Zodiac! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_IPAUhoUJwigHSOu4gpzcw">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_IPAUhoUJwigHSOu4gpzcw</a><br /><br />D3lteX: Del has been one of my best friends for as long as I've been on Discord! He's the one who thought of the name Graceful as well! He's an incredible player! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7xuHGj_N4F3KxYuYWUvjdg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7xuHGj_N4F3KxYuYWUvjdg</a><br /><br />BGram: He's been trying to beat Zodiac recently and hes been making incredible progress super quickly!
