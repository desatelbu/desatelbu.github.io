{% raw %}Are we intentionally separating ourselves by race?<br /><br />Segregation. It’s such an ugly word, isn’t it? It conjures up thoughts of racial descrimination and unfair social and housing practices. Many of us weren’t around back at a time when people were separated by the color of their skin. It was a terrible time, but those days are behind us.<br /><br />Or are they? Cause if you look around, there are still many many places in the US where entire neighborhoods are still very segregated. In many of our largest cities, entire populations are divided by race. It’s actually really shocking just how much we’ve divided ourselves.<br /><br />Back in the day, there were strict laws which FORCED people to live in certain areas of a city, and there were other underlying practices that limited where certain people could live. The term was redlining. Certain races, mostly blacks, weren't allowed to live past a certain ‘line’ in the city.<br /><br />But TODAY, it’s more of a self segregation. No one can tell you where you can live, but many of us have CHOSEN to separate ourselves from those of other races. People choose to live in communities they are most comfortable in. But, as we’ll see there’s major social and economic challenges that come when people self segregate. <br /><br />Now you’re not gonna find ANY large US city where it’s integrated and people of different races live together - that’s just the way it is. But we’re gonna look at the cities that are the MOST segregated, and talk about why. It’s actually really interesting. And we’re also talk about the US cities that are the most integrated too. Let’s dive deep into the most segregated cities in America.<br /><br />#segregation #discrimination<br /><br />You can buy my music here: <br /><br />iTunes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/state-songs-an-album/1523790725">https://music.apple.com/us/album/state-songs-an-album/1523790725</a><br /><br />Google Play: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/music/album/Nick_Johnson_State_Songs_An_Album?id=Byfshzyrbjldelqferxc6vijljm&amp;hl=en_US">https://play.google.com/store/music/album/Nick_Johnson_State_Songs_An_Album?id=Byfshzyrbjldelqferxc6vijljm&amp;hl=en_US</a><br /><br />Amazon Music: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://music.amazon.com/albums/B08D3G43VR">https://music.amazon.com/albums/B08D3G43VR</a><br /><br />Civil Rights footage: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcKvLBMPBfE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcKvLBMPBfE</a><br /><br />Memphis - Southern Life: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkZqVkv5PzI&amp;t=325s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkZqVkv5PzI&amp;t=325s</a><br /><br />Cincinnati, San Francisco and Portland Maps: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/walkingsf/albums/72157626354149574/with/5559860811/">https://www.flickr.com/photos/walkingsf/albums/72157626354149574/with/5559860811/</a> <br /><br />Racial Dot Map: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://demographics.coopercenter.org/racial-dot-map-access-and-use-policy">https://demographics.coopercenter.org/racial-dot-map-access-and-use-policy</a> <br /><br />Image Copyright, 2013, Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service, Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia (Dustin A.
