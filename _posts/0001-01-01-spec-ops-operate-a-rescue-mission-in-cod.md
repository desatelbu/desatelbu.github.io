{% raw %}Spec Ops Cameron and Israel return to continue their playthrough of COD: MW2 Remastered. Watch the guys pump UMPs and shoot their way through various objectives, fighting to stay alive and operating a rescue mission. Israel is still working out the friendlies from the enemies but he’s learning and definitely improving at the game. There was also the fall from Cameron but luckily that was part of the game so less embarrassing. Learn about the principles of reconnaissance and that there are no second chances and be sure to let us know what you thought of today's video!<br /><br />The sixth installment of the Call of Duty series, Modern Warfare 2, was released by Activision in 2009.

They are defending Washington, D.C. from an invasion by the Russians with members of the 1st Battalion/75th Ranger Regiment.<br />--------------------<br />Cameron Fath: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/cameroncfath/">https://www.instagram.com/cameroncfath/</a><br />His merch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.kitgodapparel.com/">https://www.kitgodapparel.com/</a><br />Israel Wright: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/myhappyself2/">https://www.instagram.com/myhappyself2/</a><br />His twitch channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/myhappyself/">https://www.twitch.tv/myhappyself/</a><br />--------------------<br />00:00 Intro<br />00:30 Hosts' Introduction<br />01:10 Mission 1<br />03:58 Mission 2<br />06:44 Mission 3<br />11:38 Conclusion<br />12:08 Outro<br />--------------------<br />Check out some of our past videos!<br /><br />Much Death, Much Destruction, Much Freedom | Spec Ops PLAY CoD: MW2 (Part 2)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/vFePlZCISV8">https://youtu.be/vFePlZCISV8</a><br /><br />Experts Play Playlist:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGAyF...">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGAyF...</a><br />--------------------<br />Up In My Jam (All Of A Sudden) by - Kubbi <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/kubbi">https://soundcloud.com/kubbi</a><br />Creative Commons — Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported— CC BY-SA 3.0 <br />Free Download / Stream: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2JnDfCE">http://bit.ly/2JnDfCE</a><br />Music promoted by Audio Library <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/tDexBj46oNI">https://youtu.be/tDexBj46oNI</a><br />--------------------<br />Stay in the loop with us on social media!<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/thebestofgam...">https://www.facebook.com/thebestofgam...</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/gamology/?h...">https://www.instagram.com/gamology/?h...</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/gamologyus">https://twitter.com/gamologyus</a><br />--------------------<br />#SpecOps #CallofDuty #ExpertsPlay{% endraw %}
