{% raw %}Coming back on youtube after nearly a year with a new video. Video about XVIc breastplate project, that was filmed nearly a year ago. This piece of armour was commissioned for LARP use, so it's not heat treated, burt it's made out of 1,5 and 2mm C45 medium carbon steel. <br />What can I say, obviously YouTube wasn't among my priorities lately ;) Instagram with its one minute format seemed much more attractive for me for that time, but in coming months I plan to share here some bigger projects again, so stay tuned.<br /><br />In case you're interested in what I do, please feel free to visit my website www.radosaus.pl <br /><br />Music from YouTube royalty free audio library, so don't expect much.{% endraw %}
