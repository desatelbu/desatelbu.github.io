{% raw %}In 'Cadeaux at the Chateau', all of the inhabitants of the Chateau de Lalande gather together to open beautiful gifts that people have sent from all over the world. All of the monetisation from these videos will be donated to a different charity each month. For the month of July, 2020, we chose the British Heart Foundation, in memory of my father, Derek Jarvis.<br /><br />I used to show the gifts as part of 'The Chateau Diaries' episodes, but you're all so very generous that we have many gifts, and if we spent the episodes opening them, we wouldn't be able to show you other aspects of chateau life! So, for those of you who enjoy watching presents being opened, and as a way to thank those of you who were kind enough to send them, I've made this new channel. Every week we will film your beautiful gifts whilst enjoying afternoon tea or aperitif together. <br /><br />It is very important to me that you know that we in no way expect anyone to send us gifts. I would like to go further than that and add that, if doing so will put you in any financial difficulty whatsoever, please, please do not send us anything. Knowing that you join us by watching 'The Chateau Diaries' gives us all an enormous boost. But for those of you who have sent these incredibly thoughtful gifts, I hope that seeing us open them gives you a fraction of the joy that you've given us ðŸ’–ðŸ’–ðŸ’–<br /><br />If you would like to see more of our life at the chateau, please go to our main 'Chateau Diaries' channel:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/thechateaudiaries">https://www.youtube.com/thechateaudiaries</a>{% endraw %}
