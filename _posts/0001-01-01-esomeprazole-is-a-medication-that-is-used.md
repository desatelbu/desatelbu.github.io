Esomeprazole is also available over the counter and is indicated for adults who have heartburn two or more days a week. Prescription-only esomeprazole is indicated for many acid-related conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD, as well as erosive esophagitis, and H. pylori infections. It is also used to prevent stomach ulcers in people taking NSAIDs.<br />Esomeprazole belongs to a group of drugs called proton pump inhibitors. It works by decreasing the amount of acid made in the stomach.This medication is available as capsules, as packets for preparation of delayed-release oral suspensions, as an injectable. The oral forms are usually taken once a day, at least one hour before a meal. Injectable esomeprazole is given directly into a vein (IV) by a healthcare provider, usually once daily.<br />Common side effects include headache, diarrhea, and nausea.{% endraw %}
