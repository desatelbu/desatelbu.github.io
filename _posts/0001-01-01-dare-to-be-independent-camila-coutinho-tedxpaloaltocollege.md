{% raw %}Males are expected to achieve career success while female counterparts are often expected to stay home and take care of children. Camila challenges widely-held assumptions about &quot;traditional&quot; roles in relationships. Camila Coutinho is one of the most influential bloggers in the world due to her simple, fun and creative writing style. Coutinho created “Garotas Estúpidas” (“Stupid Girls”) in July 2006, the first fashion blog in Brazil, which covers the main highlights of national and international fashion, beauty and lifestyle. Coutinho originally created “Garotas Estúpidas” (“Me, Stupid?”) as a way of sharing her passion for fashion with her friends, but her project collected national and international recognition in 13 years of existence. Over the years, Coutinho has collaborated with a variety of international fashion brands such as Jimmy Choo, Dior, Burberry, Diane Von Furstenberg and Dolce and Gabbana. She was the first Brazilian digital influencers to join The Society Management. With over 2.4 million Instagram followers, Coutinho is one of the most recognized bloggers worldwide, and appeared in the prestigious list on Forbes Brazil’s 30 under 30 in 2015 under the fashion and lifestyle blogger category. In 2017, she reached the Business of Fashion 500 list as one of the most influential people on fashion in the world. Coutinho launched her first book, “Estúpida, Eu?” in 2018, which tells the story of her career; transforming her hobby into a business. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
