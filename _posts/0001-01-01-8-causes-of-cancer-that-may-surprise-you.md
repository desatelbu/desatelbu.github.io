MSG - Glutamate converts to glutamine, which can feed cancer cells. <br /><br />2. Chronic stress - Stress can cause cortisol resistance, inflammation, and white blood cell suppression, which can all potentially increase your risk of cancer. <br /><br />3. Diabetes - Studies link diabetes to increased cancer risk.<br /><br />4. Zinc oxide - This is found in sunscreen, and can cause excess free radicle damage.<br /><br />5. Working night shifts - Research in 2007 concluded that working irregular night shifts is a possible carcinogen. <br /><br />6. Grilled meat/fish - Grilling meat and fish can create carcinogenic compounds in your food. Certain herbs and spices can help offset the carcinogenic effects. <br /><br />7. Breast implants - Chemicals from breast implants can leach out into your tissues, potentially increasing your risk of cancer. <br /><br />8. Second-hand smoke - An estimated 40,000 people die each year from second-hand smoke. <br /><br />Dr. Eric Berg DC Bio:<br />Dr. Berg, age 56, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis &amp; Intermittent Fasting.

His use of “doctor” or “Dr.” in relation to himself solely refers to that degree.  Dr. Berg is a licensed chiropractor in Virginia, California, and Louisiana, but he no longer practices chiropractic in any state and does not see patients so he can focus on educating people as a full time activity, yet he maintains an active license.

It should not be used to self-diagnose and it is not a substitute for a medical exam, cure, treatment, diagnosis, and prescription or recommendation.  It does not create a doctor-patient relationship between Dr. Berg and you.  You should not make any change in your health regimen or diet before first consulting a physician and obtaining a medical exam, diagnosis, and recommendation.
