{% raw %}I bought a non running 1998 Buick LeSabre with an extra engine for $500.  I suspect I will not need the engine but rather a new intake manifold and some gaskets.  Let's find out if my hunch is correct.  Then let's talk numbers and see what the return on investment was for this quick flip. <br /><br /><br />My website if you want to purchase a car or parts:  www.vehcor.com<br /><br />Amazon store:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/vehcor">https://www.amazon.com/shop/vehcor</a><br /><br />For Vehcor merch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/vehcor-3">https://teespring.com/stores/vehcor-3</a><br /><br />#boringbuildfriday<br />#buick{% endraw %}
