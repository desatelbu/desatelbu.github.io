{% raw %}Lana Del Rey was presented with the Decade Award during the Dec. 4 Variety Hitmakers brunch held in Los Angeles. After being presented the award by her “Wildflower Wildfire” collaborator Mike Dean, she thanked many of the people who helped her on her journey.<br /><br />“My managers helped me up the stairs,” she said. “I still haven’t mastered the art of walking in heels. I’m super grateful for them, Ben [Mawson] and Ed [Millett], and for this award. I’m really glad that they’re here with me. They picked me out of the bar scenes, lounge singer scenes that I was singing in for about eight years before I met them. They got me out of a deal I made for 11 records for nine grand while I was working at a restaurant and living in a trailer park. Ben did that in one hour and then the next day he flew me to London and let me live with him. In a year, I wrote ‘Video Games,’ and I was ready to make good records, I was ready to make a lot of records.”<br /><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/VarietySubscribe">http://bit.ly/VarietySubscribe</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/variety">http://www.facebook.com/variety</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/variety">http://www.instagram.com/variety</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/variety">http://www.twitter.com/variety</a>{% endraw %}
