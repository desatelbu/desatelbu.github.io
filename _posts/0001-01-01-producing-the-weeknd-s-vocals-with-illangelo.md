{% raw %}A sneak peek of Illangelo's 'Inside The Track' series in which he reveals how he captures and enhances The Weeknd's iconic vocal performances<br />Full video available exclusively on <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mwtm.com/itt53">https://mwtm.com/itt53</a><br /><br />We're delighted to bring you a series debut featuring the wonderfully imaginative producer and engineer Illangelo! Hosted at OCL studios in Alberta, this video installment takes you on a deep dive into the creative process behind 'Alone Again', the opening track of critically-acclaimed album 'After Hours' by The Weeknd. In great detail, Illangelo reveals the software and methods he used to build the lush soundscapes, pristine vocals, and punchy low end heard on this immersive mix. With two different Ableton Live sessions, he shares the elaborate signal chain applied to Abel's vocal, his broad palette of effects, the master buss treatment, and so much more. Aside from demonstrating an array of mix techniques, Illangelo discusses his philosophy of “painting” with sound and imparts his vocal tracking workflow!{% endraw %}
