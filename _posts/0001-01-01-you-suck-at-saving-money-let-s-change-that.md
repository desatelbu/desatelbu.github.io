Saving money has absolutely never been an issue for me, though I was programmed at a young age to take finances very seriously. But what if you didn't have the same?<br /><br />In this video, I want to address the things that I've done to get better at saving money, and how I've managed to keep my eye on the prize after all these years. And also, a few psychological insights into why most of us are so bad at saving.<br /><br />Below this video, I'd like you all to share your own money saving tips with the community, if you have any. Together, we can all share much more info than I can on my own.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy this one.<br /><br />0:00 - Going on an adventure<br />1:36 - The actual start of this video<br />2:36 - Our primary motivators<br />4:21 - We prioritise the pleasure of spending<br />4:59 - Why we're terrible at delayed gratification<br />5:54 - This is what's worked for me<br />9:01 - Let me know what's worked for you<br />9:40 - A short intermission<br />10:29 - Having a physical representation of your savings<br />11:55 - Turning saving into a habit<br />12:58 - Tell yourself better stories<br />15:47 - &quot;Things&quot; will never make you happy<br />16:58 - Find your financial balance<br /><br />‚ñ∫ IMPORTANT LINKS:<br />Enter your email below for free weekly lessons and insights into becoming financially free, investing, global tax and corporate structures, passports, residencies, and more.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.abundantia.co/">https://www.abundantia.co/</a><br /><br />‚ñ∫ SOCIAL MEDIA:<br />‚Ä¢ Abundantia Instagram: @abundantia.co <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/abundantia.co/">https://www.instagram.com/abundantia.co/</a><br />‚Ä¢ Sorelle's Instagram: @sorelleamore  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/sorelleamore">https://instagram.com/sorelleamore</a><br />‚Ä¢ Abundantia Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/abundantiaco">https://twitter.com/abundantiaco</a><br />‚Ä¢ Abundantia Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/abundantiafinance">http://facebook.com/abundantiafinance</a><br /><br />Sorelle and Leon.<br />Founders, Abundantia<br /><br />Liability Disclaimer: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.abundantia.co/disclaimer">https://www.abundantia.co/disclaimer</a><br />*We may earn a commission if you buy any products or services via the links in this video's description.
