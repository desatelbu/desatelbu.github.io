{% raw %}Welcome to another episode of squishy makeovers, where I transform ugly, used, old, dirty, cheap or unwanted squishies (donated by my subscribers) into my own creations. I repair, paint and cut away for hours on end to complete these. Hopefully you like them. Get used to lots of rainbow and sprinkles, because I am addicted to both!<br /><br /><br />_________FAQs__________<br /><br />1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?<br />So many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already, BUT if you desperately want to, you can request my mailing address in the email ALLLL the way at down in the description (sorry for the traveling), make sure to read the disclaimer down there as well.<br /><br />2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?<br />No. These squishies  are sent as donations to the series because they were damaged, and no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. It would be waaay too complicated/expensive and massively time consuming to keep track of everyone and return each squishy. I'm just one person! <br /><br />3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?<br />I use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.<br /><br />5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?<br />The matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.<br /><br />6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?<br />I would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off very easily. <br /><br /><br />___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________<br /><br />Hey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh ðŸ˜‚ ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 26 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating, painting and general art videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess. And even some baking (REALLY bad at that, but it's fun to try LOL). <br /><br />CURRENT SERIES:<br />Squishy Makeovers: Fixing and decorating used squishies sent from my viewers<br />Thrift Store Makeovers: Fixing and decorating stuff I find at thrift stores/yard sales<br />Bake With ME: Recreating squishies I've decorated in real life<br />Create This Book: Drawing in the prompt book that I wrote (available to purchase and follow along)<br />Squishy Unboxing: Opening used squishy packages sent from viewers<br />Craft Kit Testing: pretty self explanatory. testing craft kits.<br /><br />Find Products I Use (contains affiliate links):<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://a.co/4XDtrmV">https://a.co/4XDtrmV</a><br /><br /><br />___UPLOAD SCHEDULE___<br /><br />Every Friday at 4:00pm ET: Alternating Squishy Makeovers, Thrift Makeovers, Craft Kit Reviews, Create This Book, Mail Openings and Miscellaneous crafts and DIYs<br /><br /><br />____PURCHASE ME PRODUCTS____<br /><br />CREATE THIS BOOK:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2vUerfI">https://amzn.to/2vUerfI</a><br /><br />CREATE THIS BOOK 2:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Nx2G9f">https://amzn.to/2Nx2G9f</a><br /><br />ME Custom Merchandise:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://moriahelizabethmerch.com/">https://moriahelizabethmerch.com/</a><br /><br />ME Pin &amp; Sticker Shop:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://me-merch.myshopify.com">https://me-merch.myshopify.com</a><br /><br />ME Printed Apparel and Accessories:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://moriah-elizabeth.teespring.com/">https://moriah-elizabeth.teespring.com/</a><br /><br /><br />____ME SOCIALS____<br /><br />INSTAGRAM: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficial/">https://www.instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficial/</a><br /><br />TIKTOK:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@moriahelizabeth">https://www.tiktok.com/@moriahelizabeth</a><br /><br />FACEBOOK:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Moriah-Elizabeth-102592864903627">https://www.facebook.com/Moriah-Elizabeth-102592864903627</a><br /><br />SNAPCHAT:<br />MoriahOfficial<br /><br />VISIT ME WEBSITE:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.moriahelizabeth.com/">https://www.moriahelizabeth.com/</a><br /><br /><br />____CONTACT ME____<br /><br />EMAIL PICTURES OF YOUR ART (Create This Book or Fan art only please):<br />Artwork@Moriah.video<br /><br />FOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES/OPPORTUNITIES ONLY:<br />moriah@nightmedia.co<br /><br /><br />_____MAIL ME_____<br /><br />For sending squishies, Letters, or general fan mail, please contact: FANMAIL@MORIAH.VIDEO to request my P.O. box address <br />(must be 13+ to send mail)<br />ATTENTION: Unfortunately I can only respond to a small amount of people each week.
