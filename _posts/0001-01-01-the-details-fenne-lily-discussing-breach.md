{% raw %}The Details is our video series in which Molly Mary Oâ€™Brien interviews an artist about five special details from a recent musical release. <br /><br />The latest episode features singer-songwriter Fenne Lily, whose 2020 album Breach, her first for Dead Oceans, survived not one but two disastrous data-loss incidents (broken phone, stolen laptop) during the writing process. Fenne's tunes found new life thanks to the city of Chicago and its freezing weather, key change indecision, and her longtime dream of &quot;auditioning&quot; vocal microphones.<br /><br />Watch the video to get an inside look at Breach and subscribe to The Alternative's YouTube channel to be the first to catch new episodes.<br /><br />More news, reviews, recommendations and interviews on www.GetAlternative.com<br /><br />Listen to Fenne Lily here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fennelily.bandcamp.com/album/breach">https://fennelily.bandcamp.com/album/breach</a>{% endraw %}
