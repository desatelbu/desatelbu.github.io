{% raw %}I removed a large cyst on this patient (don’t worry coming soon), I then noticed a decent sized blackhead right beside the cyst we removed, I squeezed it out and then punched out the sac that was the lining of the pore that was clogged. So that black pearl will never become a large cyst like it’s big brother beside it. Thanks to my patient for sharing. Happy thanksgiving to everyone and Happy Thursday to my European and non North American followers! Blackhead extraction. Cyst removal. Big squeeze. Dermatology procedure.
