{% raw %}This is our first passage together with just the two of us and also the first one on Arktika. Hope you enjoy! Sorry for the intermittent audio issues with this video! <br /><br />Want to support my small production? You can do so on Patreon, thank you for even considering this! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/alluringarctic">https://www.patreon.com/alluringarctic</a> . Patreon is a crowdfunding platform for creators. Your support on Patreon lets me allocate more time into shooting+editing these videos. As a Patron you get access to a real-time boat tracker (with track and location infos), real-time updates (photos and random crap not suitable for wider audience) and access to our very own Arctic sailing WhatsApp group. It really helps me out, thanks a lot!<br /><br />More updates at: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/alluringarctic/">https://www.instagram.com/alluringarctic/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/alluringarctic/">http://www.facebook.com/alluringarctic/</a>{% endraw %}
