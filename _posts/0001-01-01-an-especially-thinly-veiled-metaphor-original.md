{% raw %}written in august/september 2019<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Once upon a time, I held her hand, I said: “I will go with your, where you stand I stand<br />We will not be a sensation, we won’t raise our bids<br />I won’t let you be a story that they tell their kids”<br />But now she’s crying<br />Once upon a time, I would have drawn her line, but she stole my pen, she’s saying “I am fine<br />I don’t need your help, I’ll do this on my own” and still I feel I should have known<br />That she was lying<br /><br />She’s just a child who thinks she’s seen it all, she’s running wild waiting for her fall<br />And can you not see how you’re scooping her out, she who was dancing and singing and loud<br />She is hiding in a corner and her voice is gone and yet she’s getting up, she’s trying to move on<br /><br />Once upon a time, I was by her side, I was holding her hand, I was glowing with pride<br />And I said “She is great, guys, can’t you tell?” But I think that they could just a bit too well<br />And now she’s dying<br />Once upon a time, I let go too soon, I said: “Girl, you’ve got this, just be home by noon”<br />She was home by three, she was shaken down<br />And she said: “I was so good, I felt like I might drown”<br />But she was sighing<br /><br />She’s just a kid who thinks she’s doing well, she’s gotten rid of all she had to sell<br />And can you not see how you’re scooping her out, she who was dancing and singing and loud, <br />Would you prefer to see her on her knees?‘Cause I’m sure she’ll do just whatever you please<br />She’s out of control, she’s run away, can you not see that she is just a child astray?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />But maybe you like that? I think you might like that?<br />Would that be so bad? If you were to like that?<br /><br /><br />Once upon a time, I will hold her hand, I’ll say: “I will go with you, where you stand, I stand”<br />But there’ll always be touches we pretend she’s forgotten<br />And memories sweet turned suddenly rotten<br /><br />And can you not see how you’re scooping her out? She who was vibrant and perfect and proud?<br />Or do you believe she is prettier like this? Shivering, aching, pretending it’s bliss?<br />But maybe you like that?I think you might like that?<br />Would that be so bad? If you were to like that?{% endraw %}
