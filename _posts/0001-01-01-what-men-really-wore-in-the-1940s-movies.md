They were looked up to, people aspired to be them. But not anymore. With warfare bringing the classes together on the battlefield the culture had shifted and the status of the aristocrat was dying. <br /><br />And as one might expect in the war period, one’s clothing also spoke volumes about one’s patriotism! Therefore in much of this video we will be talking about how rationing and military styles affected and influenced men's fashion in the 1940s.<br /><br />01:54 Hats<br />03:04 Hairstyles and Facial Hair<br />03:55 Eyewear<br />05:39 Shirts<br />08:49 Neckwear<br />10:26 Waistcoats<br />11:22 Suits &amp; Odd Jakcets<br />15:42 Trousers (&amp; Zoot Suits)<br />18:22 Footwear<br />20:09 Accessories<br /><br />You can see that a lot of what was worn in the 1940s could be recognized as far more modern than previous decades. The 1940s was an era hard hit with war, austerity, and rationing and this greatly affected what could be worn. Many people were mix-matching their clothes, others were wearing old clothes to save money,<br /><br />The 1940s made wearing simple open, soft shirts and comfortable slacks mainstream. Of course, this is an incredibly interesting decade. And we would love to explore more of the obscure garments, interesting fads, and eccentricities of this era in future videos. <br /><br />So if you’d like to see us cover more on Zoot Suits, workwear or the Cowboy fashions worn in the 1940s, or other historical fashion fads for that matter, please us know in the comments below! <br /><br />22:21 Outfit Rundown{% endraw %}
