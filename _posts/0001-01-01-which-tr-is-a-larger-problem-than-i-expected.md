{% raw %}In today video, I give some thoughts on my interview with Dr. Jeff Riddle. It turns out that the &quot;Which TR&quot; question I asked is a much bigger problem than a cursory look entails. Here I explain why I can't fully commit to the confession/traditional text position after giving some thoughts on my interview with Dr. Jeff Riddle. I love the TR, or the Traditional text, or the Confessional text... whatever you want to call it, but I fall short of considering it the 100% 'Kept pure in all ages' text.<br /><br />~~~ Resources ~~~<br /><br />Evangelical Text Criticism Blog on the Comma Joanneum: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://evangelicaltextualcriticism.blogspot.com/2021/12/on-comma-johanneum-in-printed-editions.html">http://evangelicaltextualcriticism.blogspot.com/2021/12/on-comma-johanneum-in-printed-editions.html</a><br /><br />Responding to the &quot;Which TR&quot; objection by Dr. Riddle:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.jeffriddle.net/2019/11/wm-140-responding-to-which-tr-objection.html">http://www.jeffriddle.net/2019/11/wm-140-responding-to-which-tr-objection.html</a><br /><br />The TBS Statement of Doctrine of Holy Scripture:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.jeffriddle.net/2019/11/wm-141-resource-tbs-statement-of.html">http://www.jeffriddle.net/2019/11/wm-141-resource-tbs-statement-of.html</a><br /><br /><br />~~~ Contents ~~~<br /><br />0:00 Introduction<br />1:00 Thoughts on the interview<br />1:25 We agree on a lot of things<br />2:46 Underlying presuppositions on how textual criticism is done<br />4:00 Confessional / Traditional text is NOT KJVonlyism<br />5:12 The Which TR Question<br />6:52 Kept pure in all ages<br />7:45 Defining &quot;Textus Receptus&quot;<br />9:06 Several edition of the TR.<br />10:01 What is 'pure'?<br />11:28 Making a concession to the TR Advocates.<br />12:58 Some people coming on the show!<br />14:06 Conclusions<br /><br />#TextusReceptus #WhichTR #AlmostConvinced{% endraw %}
