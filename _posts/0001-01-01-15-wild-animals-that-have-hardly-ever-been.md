{% raw %}Some animals are so rare in this world that they are hardly ever caught on camera. That is what makes this video so special because it combines rare footage of these extraordinary animals who are found in some of the most hard-to-reach corners of our planet Earth. With this video, we want to shed light on wild animals which are super elusive and are only found in special habitats. Like the purple frog on our list which looks more like a blob than a frog and it is hard to believe that an animal like that can exist until you see it for yourself. But hey seeing is believing and you have to watch this video to surprise yourself and know about these exotic animals that mostly stay away from humans. We went to great lengths to find these animals that have hardly been ever seen just for you.<br /><br />Sources: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pastebin.com/">https://pastebin.com/</a><br />Music: Ben sounds/Youtube Library<br /><br />SURPRISED wants to bring via top 10 and top 5 lists actual education and entertainment to all English viewers.
