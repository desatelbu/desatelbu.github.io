{% raw %}As I record this video life seems to be returning to some kind of normalcy but not the normal we have defined in the past. We have changed. The world has changed. Everything seems different and get we crave familiarity and want to embrace the world as it was. <br /><br />In this video we talk about what this new normal looks like for older women. More than any other age group perhaps we have the experience and perspective to adapt and put things in perspective. But there are some ways to merge back into the world and venture out again into the life we enjoyed 2 years ago.  It may be different, but in the video we ask if it is better! <br /><br />How about you?  Are you returning to normal? What are you keeping and what are you letting go?<br /><br />*****MAKE MORE FRIENDS THIS YEAR!*****<br /> <br />If you believe in our mission to improve the lives of women over 60, please consider supporting us on Patreon.
