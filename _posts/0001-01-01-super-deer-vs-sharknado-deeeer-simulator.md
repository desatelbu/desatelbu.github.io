Run around town freely taking advantage of the main character's deer-specific attributes, such as your stretchy neck and your stabby antlers!<br /><br />Put simply, Deeeer Simulator is a &quot;Slow-Life Town Destruction Game&quot;. You can spend your days enjoying a nice, relaxed frolic here and there together with the other animals around town, or you can choose to relieve some stress and absolutely destroy the town and everything in it. Of course, if you choose the destructive route, you may end up being chased down by police and meeting a tragic end!<br /><br />Smash through everyday life in an unassuming town to unleash the true power of the deer!<br /><br />I hope you guys enjoyed this Deeeer Simulator gameplay!
