Usually heralded by snow on the ground, Christmas trees and Mariah Carey. And, it seems, a new Covid-19 variant. On this week's podcast, columnists Allison Pearson and Liam Halligan weigh in on the latest developments and tell us why they're confident festivities mustn't take a hit, despite some scientists acting as if the UK is in the eye of the pandemic storm.<br /><br />Making her second trip to Planet Normal is revered Oxford University epidemiologist Professor Sunetra Gupta, who tells our co-pilots why we are ‘overplaying’ the hype around the new variant, whilst ‘undervaluing’ the power of natural immunity. And immediately Allison's blood pressure drops.<br /><br />Plus our co-pilots unveil a surprising Planet Normal hero of the week.<br /><br />Telegraph subscribers can listen to the full interview with Professor Sunetra Gupta: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/2021/12/02/planet-normal-shouldnt-have-panicked-omicron-ever">https://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/2021/12/02/planet-normal-shouldnt-have-panicked-omicron-ever</a><br /><br />Sign up for 30 days’ free Telegraph subscription: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/normal">https://www.telegraph.co.uk/normal</a><br /><br />Read more from Allison Pearson: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/allison-pearson/">https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/allison-pearson/</a><br /><br />Read more from Liam Halligan: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/liam-halligan/">https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/liam-halligan/</a><br /><br />Listen to Brian Moore's Full Contact: www.playpodca.st/fullcontact<br /><br />Telegraph.co.uk and YouTube.com/TelegraphTV are websites of The Telegraph, the UK's best-selling quality daily newspaper providing news and analysis on UK and world events, business, sport, lifestyle and culture.{% endraw %}
