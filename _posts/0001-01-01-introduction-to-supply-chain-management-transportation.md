{% raw %}Basic introduction to supply chain networks, with an example, and then a focused discussion of transportation and the supply chain.<br /><br />A &quot;supply chain&quot; is a network of suppliers, materials, manufacturers, distributors, and customers. It becomes a &quot;network&quot; when there are multiple links or connections between various players or agents and levels in the &quot;value chain&quot; of the product.<br /><br />This video defines the supply chain as a network. A simple network diagram is shown to demonstrate how quickly the supply chain can grow in complexity even though each individual position in the chain has only a few choices. An example of bottled pineapple juice is then used to demonstrate how the supply chain can quickly grow to cover long distances and many countries.<br /><br />In the second half of the video, the importance of transportation to the network is argued by discussing how different transportation modes are significantly different from each other. <br /><br />Transportation is presented as falling into one of four primary categories: air, road, sea, and rail. Each of these modes are characterized by cost, speed, fuel consumption, and their ability to serve specific locations.<br /><br />Finally, the video comments on the relationship between transportation reliability, or variance, and inventory. Higher variance, less reliable, transportation leads to higher quantity, more expensive, inventory, and vice versa.{% endraw %}
