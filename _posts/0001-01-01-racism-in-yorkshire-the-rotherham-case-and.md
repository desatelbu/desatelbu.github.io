{% raw %}The definition of racism is in the process of being changed in Britain and America, so that only those in a position of power in society may be guilty of such a thing. This means that however those belonging to any ethnicity, other than that of white European, behave, they can never have this accusation levelled against them. The disadvantages of this new dictionary definition are obvious to everybody other than academics and intellectuals.
