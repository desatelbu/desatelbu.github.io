The journey he made from Samoa to NZ to Australia was a difficult and inspiring one, but also fraught with mistakes, regret and terrible choices. i like to think he was building something beautiful,  and pondering what life had given him in spite of his mistakes and concealment. we never knew his story until after he died, so this is the most poetic interpretation of his affinity for gardening that I could think of.'<br /> - dave<br /><br />--------------<br />Follow Gang of Youths:<br />Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goy.ffm.to/spotify.oyd">https://goy.ffm.to/spotify.oyd</a><br />Apple: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goy.ffm.to/applemusic.oyd">https://goy.ffm.to/applemusic.oyd</a><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goy.ffm.to/website.oyd">https://goy.ffm.to/website.oyd</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goy.ffm.to/facebook.oyd">https://goy.ffm.to/facebook.oyd</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goy.ffm.to/twitter.oyd">https://goy.ffm.to/twitter.oyd</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goy.ffm.to/instagram.oyd">https://goy.ffm.to/instagram.oyd</a><br />Merchandise: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goy.ffm.to/store.oyd">https://goy.ffm.to/store.oyd</a><br />Join Gang of Youths mailing List: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goy.ffm.to/mailinglist.oyd">https://goy.ffm.to/mailinglist.oyd</a><br />Gang of Youths on tour: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goy.ffm.to/shows.oyd">https://goy.ffm.to/shows.oyd</a><br /><br />LYRICS:<br />i was young it was the 60s you see<br />i never wanted to be the chief of anything<br />so it was singing in the church for me <br />behind the organ was as close as i'd ever be <br />there was a woman that i knew before<br />she was in auckland she was spoken for<br />my hair was short my skin was brown <br />i did construction work from town to town<br />there were things we did and should not have done<br />been half a century since i seen my sons<br /><br />lord knows if<br />they would ever forgive me I won’t<br />forgive myself at least<br />there are strange forces<br />in the air only time can unleash<br />in a way i still believe<br /><br />i fell in love it was the 90s you see<br />i met a woman across the tasman in ‘83<br />and we settled down and raised a couple kids<br />but i couldn't bring myself to tell ’em what I did <br />i hope that one day if they find my sons  <br />they’ll tell ’em everything that I’ve become<br />and i will hold it ‘til my dying breath<br />when i tend garden i will think of them<br />but my youngest kid, he can't shut his mouth <br />i guess it won't be long ‘til the truth is out<br /><br />lord knows if<br />they would ever forgive me I don't<br />forgive myself at least<br />there are strange forces<br />in the air only time can release<br />in a way i still believe<br /><br />in the instance of pain<br />i look straight down at the iris<br />if the irises fade<br />i spend days out in the yard<br />in the absence of rain<br />i take a seat down at the organ<br />and I play<br />lord I play<br />ah!{% endraw %}
