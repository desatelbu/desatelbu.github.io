{% raw %}Ever considered getting laser eye surgery, but didnâ€™t know how it worked? Allow us to help!<br /><br />There are three different main types of laser eye surgery: LASIK, SMILE, and Surface Laser Treatments, and each can be explained pretty easily.<br /><br />LASIK uses two lasers to open up a thin flap on the surface of the cornea, and then reshapes the cornea underneath. The flap is then placed back over the reshaped cornea, and heals independently with time.<br /><br />SMILE uses one laser to reshape the cornea through a small, self-healing hole.<br /><br />And Surface Eye Treatments remove the clear skin over the eye, to then reshape the cornea underneath with - you guessed it - a laser!{% endraw %}
