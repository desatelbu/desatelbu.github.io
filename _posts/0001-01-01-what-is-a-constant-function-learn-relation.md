{% raw %}Constant function (f) is a such function whose range is always same, never changing, no matter of what member is in domain the range of the function is always constant. The example of a constant function of mathematics in real life is , suppose in your family , you have one father, one mother and few children. Now if we make a function between children and mother, you will get a constant function.<br />Let's say A =  is a set of children = { anil, sunil, gita, sita}<br />B = { mother}<br />now let's define a function F from child to mother.<br />F(anil) = Mother<br />f (sunil) = mother<br />f(gita) = mother . etc for every child , the function gives one mother. This is what is called constant function.
