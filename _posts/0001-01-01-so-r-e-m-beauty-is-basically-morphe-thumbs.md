{% raw %}Thumbs up for those palette colors!! :) JOIN MY PATREON HERE: www.patreon.com/popluxe<br /><br />Hello beautiful family! Hope everyone is doing wonderful! I was SO stoked to try this out, not simply because I love Ariana, but because I enjoy trying new brands! Plus, this DEFINITELY was about the product, NOT the people behind it. <br /><br />Imagine my surprise when I spent an A$$ ton of money only to find a shipping message from Morphe. This isn't technically from Morphe I don't think, I just think Morphe is the most successful out of all FormaBrand's brands. So I would assume that everything from a FormaBrand might be distributed from Morphe's warehouse. But even so...quality-wise...literally Morphe to a T. <br /><br />Does that mean you can't support it?? Of course not! If this interests you, snag it, baby! This is (in some form) the works of Ariana, so if you enjoy her and want to support, go for it! However, as far as the originality of the products?....the packaging is about as far as the Originality Bus will take you. The shadows are lovely but are on the same level as Morphe themselves, Covergirl, Revlon, and other drugstore brands that are much more affordable. <br /><br />What did you think of this collection? I now know there were a few stars that I didn't grab, I kinda regret that...but I didn't know! So it's not as though this collection is a bust! This is more of an 'insider scoop' review, I'm not here to deter you from buying anything or to sell you. <br /><br />Thank you so much for watching and have a bootyful day!<br /><br />xoxo <br /><br /><br />00:00 Opening<br />00:52 Morphe PR?
