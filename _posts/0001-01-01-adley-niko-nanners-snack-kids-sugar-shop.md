{% raw %}Niko &amp; Adley's SNACK CAFE is OPEN!! üçøüçåüç¶<br /><br />LET'S BE FRIENDS -- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/a7ctjJ">https://goo.gl/a7ctjJ</a><br /><br />HEY EVERYBODY!! Today me and Niko opened our NEW CAFE inside our house!! It is a neighborhood snack restaurant, where we make all of our DIY food creations! And it looks like our first customers just showed up... with A LOT of babies! They said they wanted a healthy snack that is also delicious, because one baby always likes to eat unhealthy! So me and Chef Niko got to work, first we started out with waffles.. then we added tons of yummy treats like whipped cream, chocolate, cookies, syrup, sugar, and magic cereal! ORDER UP!! When we took the food to the customers they said that they wanted something more healthy, so we got them some of our Nanners! Nanners are a new tasty snack that Mom and Dad helped us make, and the best part is.. they are delicious and good for you! I had so much fun playing our new family game! <br /><br />my last video: LiGHTS OUT - HiDE N SEEK!!
