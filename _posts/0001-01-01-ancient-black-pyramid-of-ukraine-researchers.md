{% raw %}Believe it or not, there are still many ancient anomalies out there that have never been documented in the western world. Strange stone circles and machine cut stones are being photographed for the very first time, including a large construction known as the Black Pyramid. This video takes a closer look at some of these incredible discoveries as well as other anomalies from our ancient past. <br />Other topics covered in this video:<br /><br />Uzbekistan:<br /> In a remote area of Uzbekistan evidence suggests a huge object fell form space leaving behind a wake of catastrophe. Ancient fortresses remain scared and may reflect a possible connection to demise of Sodom and Gamora in the southern Jorden valley.<br /><br />Crete:<br />Crete has a long history and in particular a history associated with a massive creature half bull, half human that would tear and consume human flesh. The labyrinth may have been discovered by Russian explorers and its effects on this entering has serious implications.<br /><br />Petra:<br />New evidence suggests Petra in Jordan displays proof of its historical lineage which is much older than previously thought. Was it really a massive graveyard or the seat to an advanced stone carving civilisation?<br /><br />This channel is under ZEG UK/USA/PM LTD &amp; AdRev Management.{% endraw %}
