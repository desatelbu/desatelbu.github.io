{% raw %}#legendia #poland #themepark #gifted <br /><br />Join Tom and Stace in the last day of our amazing Poland Road trip as we spend it at Legendia! This park is one of the biggest and oldest in Poland, featuring a wide variety of unique rides all situated around a central lake. It was a very quiet day during our visit, meaning we got plenty of rides in! This action packed vlog features POVs of some of the parks best attractions, including the interactive dark ride Bazyliszek, the gigantic ferris wheel Legendia Flower, the new for 2020 rapids Dolina Jagi, and of course, the main draw for the park, the insane Lech Coaster!<br /><br />Business enquiries: <br /><br />tom-and-stace@hotmail.com <br /><br />Follow us on Instagram and Twitter: <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/tom_and_stace">https://instagram.com/tom_and_stace</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/tom.and.stace.home">https://instagram.com/tom.and.stace.home</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/tom_and_stace">https://twitter.com/tom_and_stace</a> <br /><br />Like us on Facebook: <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/tomandstace">https://facebook.com/tomandstace</a> <br /><br />Please don't forget to leave a LIKE, COMMENT and SUBSCRIBE for more exciting vlogs, with much more to come in the future!{% endraw %}
