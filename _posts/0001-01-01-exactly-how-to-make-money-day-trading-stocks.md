The majority of those who fail have one thing in common: They haven't mastered the basic skills needed to tilt the odds in their favor. However, if one takes adequate time to learn them, it's possible to be on the way to increasing one's odds of success.<br /><br /><br />World markets attract speculative capital like moths to a flame; most people throw money at securities without understanding why prices move higher or lower. Instead, they chase hot tips, make binary bets, and sit at the feet of gurus, letting them recommend buy-and-sell decisions that make no sense. A better path is to learn how to trade the markets with skill and authority.<br /><br /><br />Start with a self-examination that takes a close look at your relationship with money. Do you view life as a struggle, with a difficult effort required to earn each dollar? Do you believe personal magnetism will attract market wealth to you in the same way it does in other life pursuits? More ominously, have you lost money on a regular basis through other activities and hope the financial markets will treat you more kindly? <br /><br />How to Start Investing in Stocks: A Beginner's Guide<br /><br />Investing is a way to set aside money while you are busy with life and have that money work for you so that you can fully reap the rewards of your labor in the future. Investing is a means to a happier ending. Legendary investor Warren Buffett defines investing as &quot;the process of laying out money now to receive more money in the future.&quot;1 The goal of investing is to put your money to work in one or more types of investment vehicles in the hopes of growing your money over time.{% endraw %}
