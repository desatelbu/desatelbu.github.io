{% raw %}91-Year-Old Woman’s Visit To The Doctor Reveals She’s Been Pregnant for 60 Years<br />It had been an extremely hard year for 91-year-old Estela Meléndez. Her husband had passed away and her health was on a quick decline. After suffering from a fall, Estela had to be taken far from her village to the nearest hospital — only to discover something that would rattle her, the doctors and the world. As it turned out, she was pregnant, and there was a lot more to her story than meets the eye.<br />91-year-old Estela Meléndez and her husband Manuel González were living a life that many would describe as blessed. Living in the tiny Pacific coastal community of La Boca, Chile, several hours outside of the capital Santiago, they shared an inseparable bond that had carried them through an astonishing 74 years of marriage.<br />While the two weren’t exactly living it up in a mansion, the humble life they lived always managed to provide. Manuel’s work as a boater and fisherman ensured that the couple would always have food on the table. However, in January of 2015, Estela’s life would see some major changes on the horizon, setting off a chain of events that would result in a shocking revelation.<br /><br /><br />#did_you_know  #lifestory #Pregnant{% endraw %}
