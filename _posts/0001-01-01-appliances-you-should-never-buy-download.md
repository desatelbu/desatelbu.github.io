Some are cleverly marketed, so you won't know until they have taken residence in your kitchen or laundry room. Then it's too late. Having a framework of what not to do will bring you closer to a functional and well-designed kitchen. In this video, you will learn about the top appliances to avoid. You also see some worthy alternates to consider.<br /><br />Many of these problems are annoying yet manageable. Air frying modes, for example, don't work, but the rest of the stove functions do. Having a super quiet yet expensive dishwasher is not the end of the world. I can always say that the steam oven will add to my resale. It's also a great place to hide my daughter's chocolate bears. We never use it, so she doesn't think to look. <br /><br />However, choosing the wrong cooking appliance and ventilation is a big problem. Plan those well, as they will go a long way to enjoying your kitchen and the rest of your home.  <br /><br />---------<br /><br />Learning Center:<br /><br />Visit our Learning Center, home to all our most popular videos, articles, and buying guides about all things in the appliance world. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://blog.yaleappliance.com/resource-center">https://blog.yaleappliance.com/resource-center</a><br /><br />Yale Appliance:<br /><br />Browse hundreds of in-stock products from the most popular appliance brands. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.yaleappliance.com/">https://www.yaleappliance.com/</a><br /><br />If you liked this video, don't forget to LIKE and SUBSCRIBE.
