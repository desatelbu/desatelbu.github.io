{% raw %}Today AWP began our search for 84-year-old Nadine Moses who was last seen on May 4, 2021, shortly after 5:00 a.m. in Marine City, Michigan. <br /><br />Her 2011 dark blue Ford Edge SUV was spotted on two surveillance cameras in Marine City. <br /><br />The last activity tracked on her cell phone was 5:08 a.m. in that same area of M-29 and Fairbanks Street and 4 minutes later, the phone completely went off the grid at 5:12 a.m. as though it has been submerged underwater. <br /><br />AWP was first contacted by Nadine's daughter-in-law keeping AWP updated over the past several months as the search continued. <br /><br />Beginning our search on the Southside of Marine City at the public boat ramp, Jared and Doug ran 2 sonar boats North towards the Belle River where they spotted a target matching the length of the missing vehicle. <br /><br />After attaching a magnet to verify that it was metal, Jared dove 20' underwater, 35-45' from shore, and verified that the vehicle and plate matched Nadine's missing car. <br /><br />Visibility was less than 6 inches. <br /><br />The family and local law enforcement were notified while AWP waited on the scene to offer their assistance. <br /><br />With the county having a strong dive team with top-of-the-line gear, dive assistance was not necessary from AWP. <br /><br />Upon removal of the vehicle, it was confirmed that a body was inside believed to be Nadine Moses. <br /><br />A full autopsy will need to be conducted before the final confirmation<br /><br />AWP met with the family shortly after today's discovery, prior to the removal of the vehicle and body. <br /><br />Our thoughts and prays go out to Nadine's family during this difficult time. <br /><br />We will have a full edit of our search and recovery efforts available in the next few months. <br /><br />Hug the ones you love for you never know when it might be the last time you see them. <br /><br />We are humbled by the opportunity all of you have given us to help in the search for answers as to what happened to Nadine.<br /><br />The AWP Movement would not be possible without your support, helping us travel the US offering our services for FREE to families searching for their lost loved ones...
