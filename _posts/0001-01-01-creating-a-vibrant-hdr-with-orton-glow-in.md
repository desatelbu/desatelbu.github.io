{% raw %}In this quickedit video I‘m creating a vibrant HDR photo with a strong Orton Glow effect using #Adobe #Photoshop for the Post Processing<br /><br />▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬<br />Thank you for watching my video!<br />► Prints: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.the-phlog.com">http://www.the-phlog.com</a><br />► Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/phlog">https://www.patreon.com/phlog</a> <br />► Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/thephlog">http://www.instagram.com/thephlog</a><br />► Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/phlog">http://www.facebook.com/phlog</a><br />▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬<br /><br />0:00 Intro<br />I wanted to get back those vibrant sunrise colors and make this photo look a little warmer. Since this was a super contrast rich scene, I decided to merge an HDR to save all details from the dark areas and most of the details from the bright parts (I wanted to have a little over exposure in the sky for a stronger glow effect later). All the editing was done in the camera raw editor and Photoshop (plus the Nik Collection plug in).<br /><br />0:20 1. Basic Adjustments<br />I started by merging the HDR in the camera raw editor. Then, I activated the lens corrections, switched the camera profile to Adobe Standard and set the white balance to cloudy for a little warmer color tones. To get back detail from the bright parts, the highlights were dropped. To brighten everything up I increased the shadows and the blacks. Also, I added a lot of contrast.<br /><br />2:50 2. Local Adjustments<br />First, I added a few graduated filters for the sky. I wanted it to be a bit darker, so I dropped the exposure. To make it look softer I used negative texture and clarity. Another graduated filter was added over the foreground. Here I increased the contrast, added clarity and dropped dehaze.<br /><br />To add some glow to the sky I used a small radial filter. Inside of it, the blacks were increased and the dehaze was dropped slightly.<br /><br />6:27 3. Color Grading<br />As the blue part of the sky had a too strong purple tone for my taste, I started by carefully dropping the blue hue. Then, I reduced the orange and yellow saturation. To give the photo stronger sunrise colors I applied a warm tone to the highlights and midtones using the split toning.<br /><br />7:48 4. Photoshop<br />As there were a few sensor spots and other distracting things, I started by cleaning up the photo using the spot healing brush. Also, I wanted to enhance the glow some more. For that I used a soft light layer and a warm brush with a low opacity and simply painted in some more glow. To make the foreground a little more interesting, the stones standing out of the water were made a little brighter.<br /><br />Finally, I used the Nik Collection plug in to add the polarization and glamour glow effect to make the colors look better and add a nice orton glow effect.{% endraw %}
