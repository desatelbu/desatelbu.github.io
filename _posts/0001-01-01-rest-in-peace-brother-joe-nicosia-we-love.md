{% raw %}Joe was a tremendous Prayer Warrior, who LOVED Our Lord and was focused on saving souls. Please join us here on this channel for one last night to pray along with Joe and to say your goodbyes to our Brother Joe. Pray for his soul, that's what he would have wanted most. I'm sure that Joe is praying for all of you as well. The Rosary i'm airing was one of the first that I livestreamed here on this channel. Joe, if you're reading this, I will miss you. - Jonathan -{% endraw %}
