{% raw %}Woman Feeds Crumbs To Pigeons, Then Receives A Note That Changes Her Life<br />Lauraâ€™s hands tremble as she reaches towards the note. This was not what she expected when she started her shift this morning. This was supposed to be an ordinary day. Something was inside the note and she had a feeling it was anything but good.<br />Her body feels warm and she can feel her heartbeat in her throat. She grabs the note and with every move she makes her breath quickens. She opens the note up, and her eyes carefully caress the text inside. She begins to read it, and right there and then a terrible feeling hit the pit of her stomach. <br />For Laura Jones, working in retail was not her dream job. Far from it. She had been working in her local clothes store for two years and with every dollar she earned, she put towards her dream of moving to Australia. What could be better than the sun, beaches, and glorious warm weather? <br />But then one day, everything changed for Laura, and her whole world turned upside down. <br /><br /><br />For copyright matters please contact us at: copyright@dduknow.com{% endraw %}
