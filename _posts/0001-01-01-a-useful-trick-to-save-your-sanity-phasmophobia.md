{% raw %}Welcome back to Phasmophobia! In this video I show you a very useful trick to save your sanity during a hunt! This can also come in very handy to figure out if you're dealing with an early hunting ghost! This trick won't work forever because they're planning on fixing it in the next big update, but until then this is very useful and I hope you learned something! Much love and see you during the streams :D<br /><br />I stream every day on <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/insym">https://www.twitch.tv/insym</a><br />My Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/InsymTtv">https://twitter.com/InsymTtv</a><br />Join the community discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/insym">https://discord.gg/insym</a><br /><br />NOTE: This video was recorded on Phasmophobia update v0.3.1.0{% endraw %}
