{% raw %}The UK spends around £200 billion a year on welfare benefits. &quot;On Benefits And Proud&quot; explores the lives of people some of these people across Britain who are living on benefits and are proud to do so. We see 37-year-old Heather Frost labeled as the &quot;Dole Queen&quot; and her 11 kids who get £900 a week in benefit money from the government. In order to afford what she clams on benefits, she'd need a job paying £60,000 a year. We also see how single parents cope living on benefits and we meet Julie and Vinny who have been unemployed for over 6 years who play the benefits system to ensure they don't have to work.<br /><br />Only Human celebrates and explores the unique and personal qualities we all have.  Our channel offers a range of TV series and documentaries about human experiences and life journeys - while looking at the challenges life throws at us, turning ordinary people into everyday heroes. <br /><br />Like our content?
