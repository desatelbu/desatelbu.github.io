{% raw %}Did you know you can easily propagate almost unlimited numbers of strawberry plants in your own garden? Plus they make a beautiful ground cover, living mulch under bushes or trees, and provide tasty fruit as well! <br />***********↓ Click Show More For More Info! ↓***********<br />Want to stay in touch no matter what happens? Find all the videos at my channel - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://odysee.com/$/invite/@FyNyth:d,">https://odysee.com/$/invite/@FyNyth:d,</a> my blog - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fynyth.blogspot.com,">https://fynyth.blogspot.com,</a> or join Fy Nyth on social media - mewe.com/i/fynyth !<br /><br />If you are new to my channel and Fy Nyth (Welsh for &quot;My Nest&quot;) in general, welcome! I'm Ariel. Along with my husband Clay, our dogs, and some poultry, we live in a tiny house on wheels in the mountains of western Wyoming and are working on setting into our own new little homestead. I've been living this lifestyle since 2014 and my wonderful partner has joined me more recently. What will you find if you follow the channel and watch the videos? <br /><br />Real life here. I try to show the good and the bad. The ups and the downs. What works, and what doesn't. The parts I love (most of it!), and the things that suck. Not just the showroom version of a tiny house, but everyday life in a tiny house. Not just the romantic idea of &quot;homesteading&quot; or off grid life, but the everyday details of this lifestyle. We split wood for heat, fill the water tank from a gravity fed spring, and attempt to grow as much of our own food as possible between the weather and wildlife here. I hope to help others learn from mistakes and make life just a little easier for anyone else interested in pursuing a similar lifestyle. <br /><br /> We live in a somewhat harsh and cold climate, but enjoy the stunning scenery and wildlife that we are surrounded by on a daily basis. You'll also see videos of the nature and wildlife around my home.
