{% raw %}BBC documentary from 2009.<br />Not great quality but as far as we know it is otherwise unavailable. No copyright infringement intended.<br /><br />The show features, among others, Ross Sinclair, Toby Paterson, Liz Lochhead, Gillies MacKinnon, Dalziel + Scullion and Frightened Rabbit's Scott Hutchison. He also closes the programme with a specially-commissioned song called &quot;Learned Your Name&quot;, which was later released as a b-side to &quot;Nothing Like You&quot;, in 2010.{% endraw %}
