{% raw %}-TIMESTAMPS-<br />00:00 Intro<br />00:10 Sterling comments<br />I didn't know it. I didn't think the club knew. Raheem is our player, hopefully he will be an incredibly important player for us. I don't know if he wants to play more.<br /><br />2:00 Confident Sterling will stay?<br />I'm not involved in contract. The club decides.<br /><br />2:20 on Newcastle takeover: Looks like Newcastle fans are happy. It's a business took over the club and the people are happy. I'm far away from why the decision was made<br /><br />2:50 Injuries? Torres will be out two months to three months. The rest fit, Aleks and Ilkay back. They trained this week and we're hapy, delighted they are back.<br /><br />4:00 Will Stones play tomorrow?<br />Maybe? We will decide today. Stones is unlucky, he played so well alongside Ruben. This season Aymer played incredibly well alongside Ruben , it's fair to let him play. Stones I'm delighted he played well for the national time, thisis why we extend the contract. He will be so important<br /><br />6:30 How did you reacts as a player when dropped?<br />I was an exceptional player, never on the bench so I cannot answer. You don't remember. I was so good. When this happens, football is to understand when you play it's the reason why I play better, to fight more<br /><br />9:10 Raheem played the CL final, he's so important. But I have to treat Cole Palmer the same as De Bruyne, both have parents, girlfriends or wives or kids or friends. I treat the same the cooker and the manager<br /><br />11:00 Ederson and Jesus update<br />No (they won't play), they played overnight<br /><br />11:15 Torres injury<br />The injuries can happen here, at home, the national teams. It happens. I know the mabnager from Spain, he treats Ferran as best as possible, doesn't want him to get injured. They try to take care, sometimes it happens<br /><br /><br />HaytersTV â€“ Football Up Close.
