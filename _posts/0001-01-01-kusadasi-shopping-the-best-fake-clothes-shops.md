{% raw %}KUSADASI SHOPPING | The best fake clothes and handbag shops in Kusadasi Turkey - Fake clothes shopping in Kusadasi shops in Kusadasi City Centre. <br />Also watch KUSADASI MARKET  - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KhgqHk8aIY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KhgqHk8aIY</a><br />We found the best shops in Kusadasi for fake clothes and fake handbags shopping!<br /><br />LIKE AND SUBSCRIBE!<br />Subscribe to our channel here ðŸ‘‰ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/GimbalWalkTV">https://bit.ly/GimbalWalkTV</a><br /><br />This video takes a walk around Kusadasi Town Centre to find the very best shops in KuÅŸadasÄ± Turkey where you can buy a fake handbag and fake sneakers. We managed to find it! Watch till the end to see what we bought in this amazing fake clothes shop.<br /><br />Kusadasi has a large shopping area where you can find fake trainers, clothes and handbags from labels like Adidas, Nike, Yeezy's, Gucci, Balenciaga, Supreme, Prada, Stone Island, Fendi and lots more including the best fake bags in Turkey<br /><br />If you are shopping for fakes then I would definitely recommend the shop in this video. I personally think it's the best shop in Kusadasi and is right next door to a trainer shop if you want to get yourself some fake Yeezy trainers that look and feel almost as good as the real originals!<br /><br />Kusadasi shopping centre is huge and appeals to holidaymakers, visitors and tourists and of course travellers on the cruise ships that dock in the port here.<br /><br />There is also the Wednesday market and you can try Kusadasi Bazaar but I would recommend sticking to the clothes shops in Kusadasi City Centre as the prices are better and the quality of the fake handbags and fake clothes is a lot better.<br /><br />If you would like to know where the shops are that are featured in this video go to Hatice Hanim Mosque, Camikebir, Kahramanlar Cd., 09400 Kusadasi / AydÄ±n, Turkey, Right next to Murphys Restaurant near Ä°nÃ¶nÃ¼ Blv. (any taxi can take you straight there), and it's just a short walk uphill from the cruise ship dock.<br /><br />I honestly can't recommend shopping in Kusadasi City Centre enough. The experience is great, the people are really friendly and welcoming and you'll have a great time in the shops here and it's better than all the hustle and bustle of the market or bazaar although I'd recommend going there too just for the experience of haggling and bargaining to get the best prices!<br /><br />In these shops haggling and bargaining is expected too so don't take the first price and be prepared to haggle for the very best price for your fake clothes here. <br /><br />If you're in any doubt after watching this video, head to Kusadasi where you will find the best fake bags in Turkey<br /><br />â–º MERCH STORE<br />Support my channel by getting yourself some official merchandise and t-shirts!<br />Shop here ðŸ‘‰ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/gimbalwalktv">https://teespring.com/stores/gimbalwalktv</a><br /><br />â–º Please support me for the next better videos! <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://paypal.me/gimbalwalktv">https://paypal.me/gimbalwalktv</a><br /><br />â–º GIMBAL WALK TV SOCIALS<br />Youtube  ðŸ‘‰ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/GimbalWalkTV">https://bit.ly/GimbalWalkTV</a><br />Facebook  ðŸ‘‰  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/GimbalWalkTV">https://www.facebook.com/GimbalWalkTV</a><br />Twitter ðŸ‘‰  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/GimbalWalkTV">https://twitter.com/GimbalWalkTV</a><br />Instagram ðŸ‘‰  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/gimbalwalktv/">https://www.instagram.com/gimbalwalktv/</a><br /><br />â–º VIDEO EQUIPMENT I USE TO MAKE MY VIDEOS<br />The links below contain Amazon affiliate links, which means that if you click on one of the product links, I'll receive a small commission from your purchases which goes towards producing these videos.
