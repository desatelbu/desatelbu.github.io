{% raw %}#CountingOn<br /><br />Josh Duggar got scolded by Judge Timothy Brooks today in a filing related to his motion to suppress evidence. The Judge specifically was angered by Josh going after the credibility of a magistrate judge. He also had to remind JOSH that due to his charges he is under a forfeiture allegation. Josh Duggar's arrogance really got him this time. <br /><br />Disclaimer:<br /><br />Without a Crystal Ball is a commentary channel.
