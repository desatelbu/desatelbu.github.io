{% raw %}How to build a small house cheap?<br />  Hi. In this video series, we'll show you the detailed construction of a small home. All construction will be carried out as simply and economically as possible in order to keep within the minimum budget.<br />  We are building this house for our elderly parents. The total area of the house is 640 square feet and the exterior dimensions are 18 by 22 feet.<br />In this first part, we will show you how to make a simple yet reliable foundation.<br />The foundation materials cost us less than $ 1,000.<br />We bought a plot of land for $ 2,500.<br />The associated costs were $ 500.<br />At this stage, the total construction costs are $ 4,000.<br /><br />Friends, we also recommend that you see how we built our creative house:<br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/f5HLrD9l8tc">https://youtu.be/f5HLrD9l8tc</a><br />And how we built a 38ft yacht in the backyard: <br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/aLZ3YmwSU44">https://youtu.be/aLZ3YmwSU44</a><br /><br />We are a happy couple of Gena and Vita<br />  We like to build a house with our own hands, so we feel as independent as possible and realize ourselves creatively.<br />  We enjoy making videos and try to make them useful. Therefore, we will develop ourselves and continue to develop this channel.<br /> We have many more DIY projects that we will definitely surprise you with.<br /> If you support family values and love to create with your own hands, welcome to our family &quot;CREATIVE GALAXY&quot;{% endraw %}
