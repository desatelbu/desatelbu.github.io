Helps release stress<br />Anxiety, stress and insomnia have become everyday terms. Be it work or study, any form of stress that keeps you up at night is unhealthy. Good news is thereâ€™s a solution! The next time you are looking to blow off some steam after a hard day, instead of hitting the local pub, put on your sneakers and get moving! Working out at night produces endorphins that act as natural painkillers. Workouts of low to moderate intensity will make you feel healthy and energized. This releases stress, reduces anxiety and improves sleep. <br /><br />2. Muscles form quicker<br />With tons of controversy surrounding when the best time to workout is, night time seems to be the quiet winner. If youâ€™ve been spending time at the gym looking to bulk up working out before bed may help. <br /><br />3. Boosts nutrition<br />Post workout food during the daytime hits differently than post workout food at night. The time following a night workout is the time when muscles and the body recovers. So, this is when you should make sure that the body has enough nutrients or fuel to give it the right boost. The theory that eating at night causes weight gain has been debunked many times over. Studies have shown that individuals who have food which is nutrient dense (especially with protein) and has only one macronutrient will allow better digestion during sleep.  <br /><br />4. Better sleep<br />The idea that working out at night will disrupt your sleep is one of the most common misconceptions. Exercise has a very good relationship with the bodyâ€™s circadian rhythm or the natural internal process that regulates sleep. Exercising before hitting the hay calms the mind which relaxes anxiety and depression. <br /><br />For more information, please watch the video until the very end.<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Subscribe to Bestie : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/tUqro6">https://goo.gl/tUqro6</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Our Social Media:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/bestieinc/">https://www.facebook.com/bestieinc/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bestiehealth/">https://www.instagram.com/bestiehealth/</a><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Medical Disclaimer: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pastebin.com/xLmigD6i">https://pastebin.com/xLmigD6i</a>{% endraw %}
