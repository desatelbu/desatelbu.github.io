{% raw %}What is the value of a supercar? Is it what it is literally worth, or is the value in the enjoyment and experiences? With the market changing dramatically in recent years, and the choices for the @Shmee150 collection, here are some thoughts on the topic.<br /><br />There's no right or wrong answer to many of the questions that surround the topic in general, but certainly plenty of opportunity for opinions and thoughts. From the extreme end of keeping a car at zero miles, never showing it, and maximising what it's worth; through to going all in with a respray, track days, road trips, lots of miles and more.<br /><br />It wasn't long ago that a limited edition Porsche would be worth less than new price, but now a new 992 GT3 is like gold dust. However, these cars are built to be driven and when it comes to the Shmeemobiles, that's what we try to do!<br /><br />Thanks for watching!{% endraw %}
