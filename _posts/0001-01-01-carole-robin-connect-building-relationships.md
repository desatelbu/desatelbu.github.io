{% raw %}Carole Robin discusses her book &quot;Connect: Building Exceptional Relationships with Family, Friends, and Colleagues.&quot; The ability to create strong relationships with others is crucial to living a full life and becoming more effective at work. Yet many of us find ourselves struggling to build solid personal and professional connections or unable to handle challenges that inevitably arise when we grow closer to others. When we find ourselves in an exceptional relationship—the kind of relationship in which we feel fully understood and supported for who we are—it can seem like magic. But the truth is that the process of building and sustaining these relationships can be described, learned, and applied. In Connect, Carole shows readers how to take their relationships from shallow to exceptional by cultivating authenticity, vulnerability, and honesty, while being willing to ask for and offer help, share a commitment to growth, and deal productively with conflict. <br /><br />Carole is a former Stanford Graduate School of Business professor who taught their legendary “Interpersonal Dynamics” course – known as “Touchy Feely” for almost two decades before co-founding Leaders in Tech, a non-profit which brings everything she taught to Tech startup CEOs and their organizations. During her time at Stanford, she served as the Faculty Director of the Interpersonal Dynamics for High Performance Executives Program and Director of the Arbuckle Leadership Fellows program. Additionally, Carole received multiple recognitions such as the MBA Distinguished Teaching Award the Silver Apple Award for her work in numerous courses and supporting alumni.
