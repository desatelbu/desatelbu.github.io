{% raw %}By popular demand, the Never Too Small Monogram Tote is here! Available now at our store - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.nevertoosmall.com/store">https://www.nevertoosmall.com/store</a><br /><br />Situated along the coast of Hong Kong, SmartZendo apartment was designed to bring Zen ideas into a small home.  In redesigning the home, architect Patrick Lam converted a chaotic, awkward space into a mindful experience of modern living, using Zenâ€™s focus to draw the scenery outside into the home. Creating an open living area allowed the addition of a raised floor, containing additional storage hidden by hatches, as well as a raisable coffee table embedded in the floor.  This also allowed the relocation of the kitchen from an irregularly shaped room into the living area, and the addition of a series of timber panels that can divide the living space into a sleeping area. Smart hardware and appliances complete the home, reducing clutter and encouraging dual purpose use of furniture and cabinetry throughout.<br /><br />#smallapartment #architecture #interiordesign <br /><br />Music: <br /><br />Produced by New Mac Video Agency<br />Creator: Colin Chee<br />Director: Alan Leung<br />Camera: April Pang<br />Producer: Lindsay Barnard<br />Editor: Jessica Ruasol{% endraw %}
