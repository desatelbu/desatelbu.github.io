{% raw %}If you want to be a genius, Richard Feynman's book is an incredibly useful read. &quot;Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!&quot; is full of short stories from taped conversations with Ralph Leighton, Feynman's drumming partner. It covers topics you would not think a physicist would be interested in, such as safe-cracking, bongo drumming, samba dancing, language learning, biology, and art. This is my book review.<br /><br />Buy the book (Affiliate): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3aBmJ0U">https://amzn.to/3aBmJ0U</a><br /><br />🎁 FREE Wallpaper Pack designed by me: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gum.co/zPvRv">https://gum.co/zPvRv</a><br />👉 FREE Creative Assets: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/kbottle">https://bit.ly/kbottle</a><br />👉 A 90-Day Self-Project: Discipline, Mindset, Direction : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/31u6LBM">https://bit.ly/31u6LBM</a><br />👉 Grow Your Twitter : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gumroad.com/a/279278707/XFFpt">https://gumroad.com/a/279278707/XFFpt</a><br /><br />👉 Course on How I plan My Projects using Notion<br />👉 Course on Roam Research for Creatives<br /> <br />Get 2 months FREE Skillshare PREMIUM Membership - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://skl.sh/374ZQ2t">https://skl.sh/374ZQ2t</a><br /><br />🔴 easy SUBSCRIBE here - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2Os7tIl">http://bit.ly/2Os7tIl</a><br /><br />📸 My Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/robsblanc/">https://www.instagram.com/robsblanc/</a><br /><br />📷 Footage by Pop:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.photojourneys.co.uk/">https://www.photojourneys.co.uk/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/journeypawp/">https://www.instagram.com/journeypawp/</a><br /><br />00:00 - Quick facts about Richard Feynman<br />00:17 - Book Structure<br />02:00 - Timing &amp; Taking Advantage of Opportunities<br />04:35 - Using His Unfair Advantage<br />05:10 - Getting out of your Comfort Zone<br />06:26 - Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!<br />06:37 - Technology always wins<br />08:12 - His first seminar at Princeton &amp; Organic Education<br />09:12 - How To Be a Genius<br />09:47 - Not taking yourself too seriously<br />10:04 - Question Everything.
