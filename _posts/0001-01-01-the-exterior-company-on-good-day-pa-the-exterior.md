{% raw %}The Exterior Company is reminding homeowners of the steps to take immediately following a storm. Insurance covers most storm damage, and it takes a trained eye to see damage on the roof. Many homeowners don't see damage, so they never call their insurance company. TEC says, &quot;It's better to be safe than sorry.&quot; It's best to get a free inspection to determine if a storm has damaged your home in any way. If there is damage, most insurance companies only allow one year to file a claim. If you miss that window, a roof replacement could be out-of-pocket.&quot;{% endraw %}
