We can evolve faster. There are paradigms for that. <br /><br />First of all, our education system is too old. Even the sciences that we are teaching, they are too old. Even the scientists have to understand they cannot completely run the system by a science that is based on the materialistic model. They have to soon incorporate quantum physics and then the theory of uncertainty and non-locality and then relate it to consciousness and we don't do that and once we do that, then we understand how we create our reality through our consciousness. <br /><br />Consciousness study is the most important study and to understand the relationship between consciousness and the particles because we are basically particles. We are just not the flesh and blood and that education should go deep into the consciousness of people right from the beginning , even when they are in kindergarten children they have to understand that we are not just the flesh and blood, we are just love, we are just particles, we have unlimited possibilities and our future can be completely without suffering and then there should be a human evolution process. <br /><br />So it is a time for us to join together and think about human evolution. Human evolution is human becoming just not an animal. We are slightly better than animals. In some cases we are not even better than animals because animals know better than us in many respects. <br /><br />Free Sounds For Success <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://academy.pillaicenter.com/course/sound-for-success/">http://academy.pillaicenter.com/course/sound-for-success/</a><br />Pillai Center: Intensely Spiritual.
