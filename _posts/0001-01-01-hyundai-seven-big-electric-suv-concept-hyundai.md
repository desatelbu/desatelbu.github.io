{% raw %}Hyundai revealed SEVEN, the new sport utility electric vehicle (SUEV) concept at AutoMobility LA.Â <br /> <br />Following the 45 concept in 2019 and the Prophecy concept in 2020, the SEVEN concept opens a new chapter for the IONIQ brand, Hyundaiâ€™s dedicated battery electric vehicle (BEV) showcase. These differentiated design and technology innovations prioritize customer values over industry norms. SEVEN is also a clear representation of Hyundaiâ€™s commitment to carbon neutrality by 2045. <br /> <br />Hyundai SEVEN concept is built upon Hyundai Motor Groupâ€™s Electric-Global Modular Platform (E-GMP), a dedicated BEV architecture. E-GMPâ€™s long wheelbase and flat platform floor enables a completely new class of vehicle that offers new experiences for customers.<br /><br />Hyundai SEVEN has an aerodynamically pure silhouette instinctively divergent from a typical SUV. The low, leading edge of the hood, a single, streamlined roofline and elongated wheelbase communicate a clear break from traditional SUVs powered by internal combustion engines. The pure volume of SEVENâ€™s minimal forms contrast with the powerful stance and commanding, rugged presence.<br /><br />In support of Hyundai SEVENâ€™s powerful road presence are wheels that feature integrated Active Air Flaps, which deploy or retract depending on brake-cooling or low-drag requirements.<br /><br />Even under darkness of night, Hyundai SEVEN is easily identified by IONIQâ€™s signature Parametric Pixel lights that deliver a Welcome Light Sequence on start-up. Parametric Pixels provide a common design thread, linking digital and analog styles, a reminder that its designers considered every aspect of SEVENâ€™s design, down to a single pixel. <br /><br />Thanks for watching  <br />Comment, like, dislike, share! ðŸ¤Ÿ  <br />Don't miss next videos, subscribe now â–º <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/5i54Vg">https://goo.gl/5i54Vg</a>  <br /><br />âœ… Source: Hyundai<br /><br />ðŸŽµ MUSIC used<br />Epidemic Sound â–º <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2OvT1SC">https://bit.ly/2OvT1SC</a> (30 days free)<br />Artlist â–º <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/30ERI6u">https://bit.ly/30ERI6u</a> (60 days free)<br /><br />ðŸ”¥ Get YOUR name on YOUCAR videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3cJEMzX">https://bit.ly/3cJEMzX</a><br />ðŸ“¦ Exclusive CAR FANS products: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://youcarstore.com">http://youcarstore.com</a><br /><br />INSTAGRAM â–º <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/youcar_official/">http://www.instagram.com/youcar_official/</a><br />FACEBOOK â–º <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/youcarpress/">http://www.facebook.com/youcarpress/</a>{% endraw %}
