{% raw %}Early on in my Betfair trading career, I hit a roadblock. Suddenly all my trading results went backwards and I thought I'd lost it!<br /><br />But over time I realised this was just the seasonality of what I was doing. <br /><br />Each sport has its own seasonality. Tennis markets start in January and move around the globe before ending in November with the World Tour Finals. Football follows a defined pattern and Horse Racing also has its quirks.<br /><br />Each one of these things could help or hinder your particular sport or trading style. But coming to terms with these will help you trade them better but also plan your personal life a bit better.<br /><br />If you are starting out, you may not spot this. But it should be something that becomes more apparent over time.<br /><br />#betfairtraing #sports #seasonality{% endraw %}
