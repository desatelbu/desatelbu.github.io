{% raw %}Night hunting with lights has been said to only be possible with a certain color. It's been said it can only be done using THIS color. But are we as hunters looking at it from a human's perspective when e should be asking what does the coyote see? For decades it's been pounded in our heads that coyotes can't see a certain color light and that MUST be why they come in to it without hesitation.  Looking for success hunting at night, our brains have openly drank the kool-aid and believed THIS color light is THE ONE! They taught us a coyote will not respond to any other color than THIS one, simply because of it's color. BUT IS THAT TRUE AT ALL??? <br />It's human nature to experience success hunting at night and want to connect or attribute that success to a specific color light we were using at the time. Why is that??? On this Night Crew episode we will discuss colors (a very touchy subject among night hunters) and show both WHAT COLOR LIGHT WORKS THE BEST and WHAT COLOR MATTERS MOST if you plan to hunt coyotes at night using a light.{% endraw %}
