{% raw %}#storagewars #crazy #$ Come, step into my office...This is my version of modern-day treasure hunting. Vlogging the good, the bad, and the really really bad, alongside a bit of everyday life. Staring yours truly and some of my very close family and friends. The grind never stops, there’s no Monday-Friday, it’s a cycle of everyday courage to wake up and level up. <br />Email     Storagestalker19@gmail.com<br />Insta.     @storage_stalker<br />FB           @Storage Stalker 2.0<br />                 <br />eBay <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ebay.com/usr/lizzielearns">https://ebay.com/usr/lizzielearns</a><br /><br />For contact and promo info, please contact Elizabeth @ lizzielearns@outlook.com{% endraw %}
