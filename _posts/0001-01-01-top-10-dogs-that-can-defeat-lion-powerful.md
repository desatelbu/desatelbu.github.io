{% raw %}Hi guys hope you all fine ðŸ˜‰<br /><br />The lion is known as the king of the jungle and with good reason. Lions are incredible hunters that possess the size, speed, and strength to cut down different kinds of prey. Male adult lions can grow to 83 inches in height and have a weight over 420 pounds. With an average bite force of over 650 psi, they pack a lot of power.<br /><br />So, if you come face to face with a lion, can your dog provide protection? If you are wondering about which dog can kill a lion alone, you are asking the wrong question. Going one on one with a lion would turn out badly for any dog.<br /><br />However, certain dog breeds attacking in a pack stand a chance. We have highlighted those breeds in this video.<br /><br />For contact :<br />canineempire3@gmail.com<br /><br />Thanks for your time ðŸ¤—{% endraw %}
