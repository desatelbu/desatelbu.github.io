{% raw %}Marvel's Avengers has made the outlandish decision to include new consumables that can be purchased within the game's marketplace to temporarily increase the amount of XP and resources that a player can acquire while playing the game. This essentially allows for fans to make faster progress - so long as they're happy to spend real money doing so. Let's discuss why this is an extremely hypocritical decision made by Crystal Dynamics &amp; Square Enix, especially after previously stating how there would be NO pay-to-win scenarios featured in-game.
