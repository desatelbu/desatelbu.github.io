{% raw %}Fashion portal Myntra has rolled out three films to showcase the width of selection available. The film showcases a range – one is for men’s fashion, another for women and a third for sportswear. In all the films, the protagonists have a silent conversation with the brands they don. The film for the range of women's brands features multiple young women wearing top of the line brands, getting ready for different occasions. While one of them is out to impress her date, another is headed to make an important presentation at work. A constant is the conversation each of them has with the brands they choose to wear – their constant companions. <br />The film ends promising the ‘Best of fashion for the best of you – handpicked women’s wear from the best brands. Only on Myntra.’<br /><br />The ad to showcase the men’s range follows on similar lines, featuring young men. As each of them gets ready to leave, choosing a set of brands each to wear and accessorise with, he has a silent conversation with the brands. One of them heads to a wedding, another on a date, and the third is off for a road trip – all dressed for the occasion by brands from Myntra. As the narrative says, they are ‘in it, together’.<br /><br />“Consumers trust and love fashion brands for the iconic stature and latest trends they offer. Our new brand campaign has been developed to showcase our curated collection of the best designs and styles, handpicked from the best of brands. I am confident that consumers will love the campaign as it brings their loved brands to them, with the trademark Myntra sense of styling.”{% endraw %}
