{% raw %}Dave Rubin of “The Rubin Report” talks to Texas governor candidate Allen West about the Biden administration’s migrant crisis, the real reason Democrats want open borders, and the dangerous effects of more people moving to red states. First, Allen shares why is running in the Texas governor election and how Joe Biden has failed to protect the Texas border. Allen explains how the wave of illegal immigration coming in at the US Mexico border threatens Texans, but other states as well. He describes how secret migrant flights run by the Biden administration have flown migrants to states like Florida and Texas without their permission. The border crisis has been caused by the failed Biden immigration policy, Allen explains what needs to be done to address it. Next, Allen explains the real reason why Democrats and the radical left have an open border agenda and how it benefits them politically. Allen also explains why it’s not just Biden’s immigration policy that is failing, but NGOs as well. He reveals how NGOs at the US border like Catholic Charities are actually making matters worse by enabling crime and human trafficking. Finally, Allen discusses how people have quickly tired of authoritarian demands for proof of vaccination and how issues like vaccine mandates and critical race theory in education are causing a massive backlash as evidenced by Glenn Youngkin’s victory over Terry McAuliffe. Allen also talks about the exodus out of states like California and New York to states like Texas and Florida. He explains how red states may soon become victims of the “locust effect” due to the blue state exodus. Allen ends with a warning about becoming a welfare dependent and how you can be turned into a slave by being forced to work for no pay, but also by being paid to not work.<br /><br />Watch Dave Rubin’s PREVIOUS interview with ALLEN WEST here: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOnPAyDIPeY&amp;list=PLEbhOtC9klbCr0iN2ANJbaV477B0eSpc6&amp;index=1">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOnPAyDIPeY&amp;list=PLEbhOtC9klbCr0iN2ANJbaV477B0eSpc6&amp;index=1</a><br /><br />Is the state of US news driving you crazy?
