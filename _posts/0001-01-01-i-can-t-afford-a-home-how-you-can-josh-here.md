{% raw %}JOSH HERE, the one, the only TLT!<br />Today we are covering a comment I hear ALL THE TIME.<br /><br />“I can’t afford to buy a house.”<br /><br />I am here to tell you that if you have a job, and have your debt in order, there is a good chance you CAN afford a home.<br /><br />The down payment scares a lot of people away. In reality you do NOT actually need 20% down!<br /><br />There are some cases where you can put as little as 1% down!<br /><br />Example of buying a home for $500,000<br />Let’s say you need to put $15,000 down.<br />You could:<br />- Save that money over time. ($416 a month for 3 years) #Planahead<br />- Receive a gift from family. (Maybe the fam wants to help you out!)<br />- Borrow against your 401k<br />- Apply for a first home buyer grant in your city/state/ (Ask google!)<br /><br />I highly recommend your first step is finding a lender who can give you a pre-approval amount and from there you can start searching for home within your price range. Once you are pre-approved you can do some math and figure out what your mortgage payment would be. (A lot of times it’s cheaper than what you are paying to rent you current place!)<br /><br />If you are watching this video on your iPhone. You spent $1000 to get it. Don’t buy a new iPhone every year and boom you’re a few thousand dollars closer!<br /><br />If you have any questions comment down below and let me help guide you in finding all the resources you need to buy a home!<br /><br />Appreciate the content?
