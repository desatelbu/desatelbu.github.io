{% raw %}Many places around the world are illegal to enter but that doesn't stop people from exploring these locations or getting footage from them. There are many reasons why you can't enter some of them but they can range from environmental reasons to top-secret ones like military zones. They could also be too dangerous or maybe a holy site that only a select few can go but today we will be talking about some of these areas from a doomsday vault to the Vatican archives!
