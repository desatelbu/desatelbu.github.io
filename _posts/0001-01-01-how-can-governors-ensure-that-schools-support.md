{% raw %}This is the second webinar of our &quot;All pupils, every ambition&quot; campaign. This session will explore the impact of COVID-19 in the classroom, focusing on how the pandemic has widened existing gaps in educational attainment and what schools can do to ensure that no pupil faces long-term educational disadvantage. We'll consider the key role governors have in supporting schools to narrow attainment gaps, exploring how schools can adapt and evolve to deliver academic outcomes beyond what might have been expected previously.{% endraw %}
