{% raw %}What you should do when you’re not really into the woman you’re dating, but feel guilty about it.<br /><br /><br /><br />In this video coaching newsletter I discuss an email from a viewer who has been following my work for about four years after his toxic ex-girlfriend monkey branched from him to another guy. Most of the women he meets and dates he’s not really into, but the few that he really does like, don’t seem to be that into him. He feels guilty about agreeing to be exclusive with women he’s dating once they ask, but he ends the relationship a few months later. He asks my opinion because he feels like sometimes he’s ready to give up on what he really wants.<br /><br /><br /><br />“Success seems to only come after much struggle and way more time invested than you expected when you started. Learning to trust your heart, curiosity and intuition when it comes to choosing friends, lovers, careers and business associates is extremely difficult when you are surround by an overwhelming majority of people who have settled for a life that is less than they are capable of living. You must do what you do and choose what you choose for your own reasons, not the reasons of others who think they know better than you do what’s best for you. It’s never crowded along the extra mile on your journey to success because most people have simply given up. Cherish, love and support those rare people who also have what it takes to succeed and be great teammates.” ~ Coach Corey Wayne<br /><br /><br />Click the link below to read this article on my website:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://understandingrelationships.com/when-youre-not-really-into-her-but-feel-guilty-about-it/63396">https://understandingrelationships.com/when-youre-not-really-into-her-but-feel-guilty-about-it/63396</a><br /><br />If you have not read my book, “How To Be A 3% Man” yet, that would be a good starting place for you.
