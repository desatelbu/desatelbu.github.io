And all the incorrect information... Watch at your own risk of boredom and possible loss of sanity.<br /><br />The Slightly Shambolic Shuffles are back! This time we are at the 2021 BMC and Leyland Show at the British Motor Museum at Gaydon in Warwickshire. In this final part, it all goes horribly wrong again as I continue to be forced to use my backup phone, as my main phone has run out of battery.<br /><br />Be prepared for terrible autofocus, the camera cutting out, hardly any stabilisation at all, more Metros, some lovely Vanden Plas, a one owner Range Rover, Mr Quirk from Planetauto wearing my merchandise and really not much of any interest at all. Nothing untoward, then!<br /><br />As an independent vehicle consultant, I take potential buyers through the whole car buying process from choosing a make and model to a vehicle handover and road tax. In addition to information on this service, I also have a selection of written and video reviews of cars that I have owned, hired, borrowed or have somehow come into my possession. Please use the Contact Me page on my website to get in touch, visit my Facebook page for latest updates and share this video if you like it! Thank you for watching. <br /><br />Website: www.lloydvehicleconsulting.co.uk<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/lloydvehicleconsulting/">https://www.facebook.com/lloydvehicleconsulting/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/lloyd_vehicle_consulting/">https://www.instagram.com/lloyd_vehicle_consulting/</a>{% endraw %}
