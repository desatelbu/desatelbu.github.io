Amielle’s first burn happened when she was just three and a half months old. Initially doctors said that she just had sensitive skin and it wasn’t until Amielle was 7 that she was finally diagnosed with XP. After the diagnosis the family took a DNA test and discovered that Taya also has the rare condition. The girl’s parents, Nick and Yvette have to take a number of safety measures when the sisters go outside. To ensure they are not exposed to any UV light at all the girls have to wear a thick layer of sunblock, gloves and a protective visor before leaving the house. Nick and Yvette hope to raise money via GoFundMe to build a covered play area in their garden so the girls can have fun outside freely. Due to their condition Amielle and Taya can only visit the beach at night to be completely safe. Truly visited the family during one of their evening trips to their local beach to see them all enjoy the seaside together.<br /><br />Support Amielle and Taya here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-ami-taya-walker-play-and-stay-safe">https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-ami-taya-walker-play-and-stay-safe</a><br /><br />Videographer: Chris Butle<br />Producers: Tom Jones, Yasmin Walker<br />Editor: Paul Zeller<br /><br />Truly is on TikTok! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show">https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show</a><br /><br />Now you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES">http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES</a><br /><br />Click here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! <br />Truly - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow">https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow</a><br />Born Different - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/">https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/</a><br />Shake My Beauty - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/">https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/</a><br />Hooked On The Look - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/">https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/</a><br />Love Don't Judge - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/">https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/</a><br />Beastly - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/">https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/</a><br />Ridiculous Rides - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/">https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/</a><br />Dog Dynasty - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/">https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/</a><br /><br />For more amazing content, click here!<br />Beastly: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA</a><br />Barcroft Cars: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured">https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured</a>{% endraw %}
