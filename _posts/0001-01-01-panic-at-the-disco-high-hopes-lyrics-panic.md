At the Disco - High Hopes<br /><br />[Intro]<br />High, high hopes<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />Had to have high, high hopes for a living<br />Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing<br />Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision<br />Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)<br />Had to have high, high hopes for a living<br />Didn't know how but I always had a feeling<br />I was gonna be that one in a million<br />Always had high, high hopes<br /><br />[Verse 1]<br />Mama said, fulfill the prophecy<br />Be something greater, go make a legacy<br />Manifest destiny, back in the days<br />We wanted everything, wanted everything<br />Mama said, burn your biographies<br />Rewrite your history, light up your wildest dreams<br />Museum victories, every day<br />We wanted everything, wanted everything<br /><br />[Pre-Chorus]<br />Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated<br />All tied up, no more love and I'd hate to see you waiting<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />Had to have high, high hopes for a living<br />Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing<br />Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision<br />Always had high, high hopes<br />Had to have high, high hopes for a living<br />Didn't know how but I always had a feeling<br />I was gonna be that one in a million<br />Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)<br /><br />[Verse 2]<br />Mama said, it's uphill for oddities<br />The stranger crusaders, ain't ever wannabes<br />The weird and the novelties don't ever change<br />We wanted everything, wanted everything (High, high hopes)<br /><br />[Bridge]<br />Stay up on that rise<br />Stay up on that rise and never come down, oh<br />Stay up on that rise<br />Stay up on that rise and never come down<br /><br />[Pre-Chorus]<br />Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated<br />All tied up, no more love and I'd hate to see you waiting<br />They say it's all been done but they haven't seen the best of me-eh-eh-eh<br />So I got one more run and it's gonna be a sight to see-eh-eh-eh<br /><br />[Bridge]<br />Had to have high, high hopes for a living<br />Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing<br />Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision<br />Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)<br />Had to have high, high hopes for a living<br />Didn't know how but I always had a feeling<br />I was gonna be that one in a million<br />Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />Had to have high, high hopes for a living<br />Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing<br />Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision<br />Always had high, high hopes<br />Had to have high, high hopes for a living<br />Didn't know how but I always had a feeling<br />I was gonna be that one in a million<br />Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)<br /><br />.........<br />üì∑ Wallpaper: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://unsplash.com/">https://unsplash.com/</a><br />.........<br />üìßContact: monstafluffmusicnetwork@gmail.com<br />.........<br /><br />#PanicAtTheDisco #HighHopes #Lyrics{% endraw %}
