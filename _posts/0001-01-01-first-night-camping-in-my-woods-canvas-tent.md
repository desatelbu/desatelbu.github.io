{% raw %}Join me as I spend the first night solo winter camping in my woodland. I use a modified canvas polish lavvu tent and a woodstove as a hot tent for this winter camping trip. It's early December and the leaves have fallen from almost all of the trees in my woodland. The air is cold, but fresh. I setup the tent, cut some firewood with the axe and get the woodstove going. I cook up some good food and enjoy the evening listening to the owls and wildlife of my woodland.
