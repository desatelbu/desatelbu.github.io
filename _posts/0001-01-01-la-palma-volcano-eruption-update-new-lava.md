{% raw %}The La Palma / Cumbre Vieja eruption is now in its 68th day. Today's main news is that a new lava flow just reached the ocean near Punta del Perdido, thus building a new lava delta. While rivers of lava have continued, overall eruptive intensity has continued to decrease, thus signaling that the eruption is in its waning stages. Earthquake activity has also decreased, alongside ground deformation indicating a lessening supply of fresh magma. Although eruptive activity is truly decreasing, the main volcanic cone partially collapsed on November 25th. This video will discuss what is likely to happen next as this Spanish Canary Island volcano. <br /><br />Social media link(s) of a scientific organization which can provide more up to date information:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.involcan.org/">http://www.involcan.org/</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/INVOLCAN">https://www.facebook.com/INVOLCAN</a>   <br /><br />Special Thanks: TV Canarias, INVOLCAN, @x_y_es (twitter)<br /><br />If you would like to support this channel, consider becoming a patron at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://patreon.com/geologyhub.">http://patreon.com/geologyhub.</a><br /><br />Another way to support this channel is to make an order via our gemstone and geology related etsy store at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://prospectingarizona.etsy.com.">http://prospectingarizona.etsy.com.</a>{% endraw %}
