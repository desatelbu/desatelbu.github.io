{% raw %}THERE IS A GIANT PHILIPPINES COLISEUM BEING BUILT IN SORSOGON BICOL... AND I HAD NO IDEA!<br /><br />We are headed to Catanduanes.  On this day, we take the boat across to Matnog from Allen Northern Samar.  After eating and sleeping at a pension house... we drive up to Sorsogon.  And that is where I get surprised by a massive coliseum!  It is huge.  I believe it may be a sports complex in the making?  Anyways, from there, we find a cool little cafe, and head up towards Legazpi City. <br /><br />Driving across the Philippines... always a unique experience!<br /><br />POWER ON!<br /><br />*** NEW #BecomingFilipino Drone Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2H-TxqnKbM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2H-TxqnKbM</a><br /><br />*** FOR HAMMOCKS AND SHIRTS JUST MESSAGE VIAJERO OUTDOOR CENTER ON FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://web.facebook.com/viajerocdo/">https://web.facebook.com/viajerocdo/</a><br /><br />*** FOR MORE STORIES AND ADVENTURES CHECK OUT MY FACEBOOK PAGE: #BecomingFilipino{% endraw %}
