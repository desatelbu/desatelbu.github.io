{% raw %}One Kerry publican says new guidelines around pubs, nightclubs and live venues aren't clear, but are &quot;clear enough for us to proceed&quot;.<br /><br />It comes as nightclubs will be able to open at 100% capacity from Friday night, once everyone attending is vaccinated.<br /><br />Up to 1,500 people will also be allowed to stand at indoor gig venues, and a 11:30pm closing time for pubs and restaurants is scrapped.<br /><br />Tables will be limited to a maximum of 10 adults, but people can make multiple bookings.<br /><br />And while table service remains, people can queue at the bar once social distancing is observed.<br /><br />George Savage is publican and owner of 'The Blasket' in Tralee, Co Kerry.<br /><br />He told Newstalk Breakfast the guidelines went further than he thought they would.<br /><br />&quot;They're definitely not clear, but they're clear enough for us to proceed definitely.<br /><br />&quot;We're delighted to be opening, we were waiting to see would we be opening.<br /><br />&quot;I think another key part of re-opening was would there be table service, because staffing etc it'll be quite challenging - so that's not really a part of it.<br /><br />&quot;And I suppose it's kind of surprising they're saying 100% - but I don't think it's practical for smaller venues like ourselves to go to actual 100%&quot;.<br /><br />George says at 100% capacity, his venue would &quot;absolutely not&quot; be able to accommodate social distancing.<br /><br />&quot;We'll have to cordon off areas close to the bar counters so that people can queue in a socially distant manner.&quot;<br /><br />But he says this is nothing new for them.<br /><br />&quot;Look it's great to get open, we're absolutely delighted to get open.<br /><br />&quot;I suppose part of our job description is that we control crowds, we have people at the front door - so checking the COVID passports and all that, that's not new to us.<br /><br />&quot;We're used to that, we're used to engaging with customers so it's not a huge shock to our system&quot;.{% endraw %}
