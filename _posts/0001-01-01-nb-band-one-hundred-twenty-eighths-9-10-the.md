{% raw %}THIS IS THE END. I will make NBBTHFS 1 at November 29 (1 month of our new home). WE HAVE REACHED 0.75'S, INCLUDING 2 VIDS IN 1 DAY AGAIN!!!!! WOWIE!!!!!! 3 more bands, then we will reach 1! Link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/596855936">https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/596855936</a> NOTE: Some things may not be saved because there was some troubles saving like seen at the end. The reason @Zata Account has to die is because he hates me, and for @The Diamonds: WNRMC ND-5 and Numberdiamond-3 is because he hates Onelean and Rodolfo. NOTE 2: The suggested video is my 2nd vid and baby vid, then comes the rest of the NB vids. Band 11 is coming at 1st Jan 2022.{% endraw %}
