{% raw %}Watch Peter Cartwright's series of online support video sessions for families affected by a loved one's substance use. <br /><br />These videos are produced in collaboration with Adfam, a national charity working to improve life for families affected by drugs, alcohol and gambling.<br /><br />The videos provide a supportive resource for families affected in this way to help you cope with your loved one's substance use and cover a wide range of themes with valuable information and guidance.<br /><br />In Session #11 Peter talks about other kinds of difficulties that often occur alongside problematic substance use. <br /><br />Peter has been supporting families affected by someone elseâ€™s substance use since 1998, and also works as a counsellor, trainer and author.<br /><br />We would like to thank both the Sidney Ivor Luck Counselling Trust and the Charities Aid Foundation (CAF)'s Coronavirus Emergency Fund for their generous support in enabling us to develop these videos. <br /><br />For more information about Adfam visit our website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://adfam.org.uk/">https://adfam.org.uk/</a><br />Follow us on:<br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/AdfamUK">https://twitter.com/AdfamUK</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/AdfamUK">https://www.facebook.com/AdfamUK</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/adfamuk/">https://www.instagram.com/adfamuk/</a>{% endraw %}
