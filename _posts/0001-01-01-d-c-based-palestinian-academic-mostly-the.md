{% raw %}U.S.-Based Palestinian professor Mohamed Rabie said that the Jews, mostly the Zionists, control American media and bribe politicians on both sides. He made these remarks in an interview that aired on Sada Al-Balad TV (Egypt) on May 27, 2021. Professor Rabie said this why &quot;they take all that money from Congress, and they turned the American people ignorant.&quot; He explained that American people are ignorant and uneducated and added that only 100-150 universities produce &quot;good graduates.&quot; <br /><br />Professor Rabie gave an example from a time when he taught at a &quot;university for Blacks,&quot; and claimed that his students could not follow the course work and he had to help them with mathematics instead of teaching economics. He added that Americans are racist, and that this is why the West committed massacres around the world. According to his social media accounts, Professor Rabie is a member of the advisory board for the Cambridge Centre for Palestinian Studies and has taught at Johns Hopkins University, Georgetown University, St. Gallen University in Switzerland, and Erfurt University in Germany.{% endraw %}
