{% raw %}Brawlhalla axe combo guide/montage. Even if you hate the axes entire kit, I hope the video was at least entertaining.<br /><br />The legends that can use the axe in game so far is: Azoth, Brynn, Barraza, Jhala, Ragnir, Rayman, Teros, Ulgrim, Volkov, and Xull.<br /><br />I didn't include every single string possible in the video but I provided the most basic and most used ones. Can you reach diamond with axe? You can reach diamond with any weapon/legend. I have not heard of an axe zero to death but if it exists, please let me know :)<br /><br />Everybody has their own opinion on weapons and legends in the game. I respect everyone's opinions like Diffensive, Shwerpy, LuciansSword etc :)<br /><br />Music:<br />FUTURE FUNK Lacheque Dragonfruit Salad<br />Heaven and Hell (AKA Super Hyper Can Can)<br /><br />I stream every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday on Twitch<br />Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/surnex">https://www.twitch.tv/surnex</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Surnexxx">https://twitter.com/Surnexxx</a><br />Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/wTFNFP">https://discord.gg/wTFNFP</a>{% endraw %}
