{% raw %}Shot around the world in 2010 and 2011, Fastest distills the thrilling, terrifying reality of the MotoGP world championship into a maximum-speed, full-length documentary feature film. Fastest captures a pivotal moment in the sport when, chasing his tenth world title, the legendary Valentino Rossi runs into the toughest challenge of his life: a wave of ferociously fast young riders, a horrific, leg-shattering crash at the Italian grand prix, an agonizing comeback forty-one days later in Germany, and the question every rider--even the greatest of all time--must face. Who's the fastest? Narrated by Ewan McGregor.{% endraw %}
