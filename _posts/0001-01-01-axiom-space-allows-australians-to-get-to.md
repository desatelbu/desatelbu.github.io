{% raw %}ANU astrophysicist and cosmologist Dr Brad Tucker says Australians having the opportunity to go into space by private companies could be “quite interesting” as it removes a NASA requirement. <br />  <br />Dr Tucker said commercial space company Axiom Space – which ferries professional astronauts to the International Space Station – has four missions planned but only two filled.  <br />  <br />“There’s no reason you couldn’t get an Australian onto one of these early missions; they already have agreements with NASA and SpaceX to work and get their spots at the International Space Station,” he told Sky News Australia. <br />  <br />“If there’s a way an Australian could be employed, it could be quite early.” <br />  <br />Dr Tucker said there had only ever been two Australians in space, but both had to be American citizens to use the NASA project. <br />  <br />“This would allow someone who wouldn’t necessarily need to get American citizenship because of that NASA requirement to go into space,” he said. <br />  <br />“It’s quite exciting because you could imagine multiple missions and multiple Australians being hired at this, especially as Axiom Space wants to grow their reach and goals and projects in space.”{% endraw %}
