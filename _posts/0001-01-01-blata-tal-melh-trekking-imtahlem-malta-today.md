{% raw %}Today's adventure takes us to l-Blata tal-Melh, which  translates as &quot;the rock of salt&quot;, due to the salt-pans here and lies on the coast of Bahrija behind the area known as L-Imtahleb. The stretch of coast lies just south of Ras ir-Raheb, just off Fomm ir-RiÄ§ Bay. The only access is on foot via a45 -minute trek down steep uneven ground. The trek gets particularly tricky nearer the bottom. Some say it was an Italian businessman who produced salt there and he had commissioned the work. The stairs would enable workers to carry salt down to a waiting boat that would take it to Gnejna. <br />Apparently, the staircase was also used as easy access for people working on the salt-pans, as using a boat was easier than walking, even if there were no sacks of salt to carry.<br />Of course, you want to see this place. It is certainly off the beaten track but well-worth the effort. Apart from the interest created by the human footprint, the location has very unique characteristics that give it a unique beauty on the whole island.<br />#Malta #Trekking #Hike<br /><br />Hope you enjoy.<br />Please like subscribe and comment.<br /><br />Pierre Farrugia{% endraw %}
