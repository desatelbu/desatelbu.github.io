See my explination of how the thermoelectric effect works. See the physics behind this process and how a thermocouple and Peltier Cell works and what we have inside. <br /><br />Important: I've made some serious mistakes and badly expressed myself in some cases. 1. When we heat materials, metal is a good conduction of heat as I tell in the video. 2. Conduction occurs when a substance is heated, particles will gain more energy, and vibrate more. Particles, not electrons as I show in the heated glass pots example. Second, these molecules then bump into nearby particles and transfer their energy to them, those energized electrons. 3. In the potential animation, electrons should flow from V- to V+. What I actually showed in the video was the current path. 4. So, as I tell in the video, when we heat the metal, the PARTICLES vibrate more and the free electrons will simulate getting more separated on the hot side and more pushed together on the cold side. That creates a small voltage difference. Sorry for any other errors if there are. I'll try to update my errors the best I can.
