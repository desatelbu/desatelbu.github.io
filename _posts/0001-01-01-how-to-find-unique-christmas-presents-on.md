{% raw %}Shop with me as we look for unique items to resale on Mercari, Poshmark and Ebay at the Goodwill outlet bins. We didn't find a ton of stuff but I did find some really cute items I can give as gifts and everything only cost me $6!  You can find great gifts that won't break the bank at the Goodwill Bins!<br /> Subscribe for more videos every Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday.  If you are interested in anything that I found visit my closets.<br />ðŸ‘” Mercari:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.mercari.com/u/959878662">https://www.mercari.com/u/959878662</a><br />ðŸ‘• Poshmark:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://posh.mk/kh0tQrcxebb">https://posh.mk/kh0tQrcxebb</a>{% endraw %}
