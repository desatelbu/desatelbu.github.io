{% raw %}Trying to survive in Minecraft, but there are custom borders (day 2)... <br />If you want to see Minecraft but Water Rises or Minecraft but Lava Rises, or any other Minecraft but challenge let me know!<br /><br />Discord Server - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://discord.gg/jveF64H">http://discord.gg/jveF64H</a><br />Minecraft Server - beretmc.com<br />TikTok - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@redberet_">https://www.tiktok.com/@redberet_</a><br />Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/redberet_">https://twitter.com/redberet_</a><br />Twitch - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/redberet_">https://www.twitch.tv/redberet_</a><br /><br />This Minecraft but challenge makes the funniest Minecraft videos without any funny Minecraft mods! Somehow this is the NEW funniest Minecraft video / short ever! Instead of any other Minecraft challenge in Minecraft 1.17, this is a Minecraft video in Minecraft 1.18 in 2021!<br /><br />The goal was to try to inform / speed run / speed runner of Minecraft against a killer / assassin but it is me, redberet, playing Minecraft Java 1.18 and not Minecraft Bedrock.<br /><br />#shorts #minecraft{% endraw %}
