{% raw %}#CProfishing<br />#Shimanofishingreels<br />#Tacklereview<br /><br />Tackle review for the new Shimano Speedmaster 16 2 speed reel. This is the new generation Speedmaster which I feel Shimano made as a cost effective Talica. With 42 inches per crank and 40 pounds of drag this reel is a workhorse for it's size. Paired up with a Star Paraflex rod this combo should be a beast hoisting big fish off the bottom, and catching up to fast pelagic's on the surface.{% endraw %}
