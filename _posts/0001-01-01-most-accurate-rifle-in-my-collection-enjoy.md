I have two rifles on the table today that do just this - the Wichita Mini and the Varberger from Sweden. Both the Wichita and the Varberger are in 6PPC and accomplish accuracy that most people wouldn't believe is possible. Bench rest shooting is a fantastic shooting discipline if you enjoy accuracy. Watch me test out the Wichita Mini and the Varberger rifle and let me know your thoughts.
