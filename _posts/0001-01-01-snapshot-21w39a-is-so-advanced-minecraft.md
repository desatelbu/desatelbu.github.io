{% raw %}Minecraft has published Snapshot 21w39a, the latest Java Edition snapshot for Minecraft 1.18 - the Caves &amp; Cliffs Update Part 2. <br /><br />This update adds four new advancements to the game, so today we're going to try getting all of them in Survival! The 'Caves &amp; Cliffs' advancement can be earned by dropping from build height to bedrock. 'Star Trader' can be achieved by trading with a villager at build height. 'Feels Like Home' requires you to bring a Strider to the Overworld and ride it through a 50 block stretch of lava, and 'Sound Of Music' is awarded for you listening to a music disc in a meadow biome!<br /><br />We also discover new mountain peak generation, explore the new mob spawning mechanics of dripstone caves, and more!
