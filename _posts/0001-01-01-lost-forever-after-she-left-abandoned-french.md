{% raw %}Exploring abandoned places is my hobby and finance it all out of my own pocket and the donations I get from the people who love watching the documentaries we make... A small donation would be greatly appreciated! ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/brosofdecay">https://www.patreon.com/brosofdecay</a><br /><br />Blending in with its surroundings next to a busy road lays a typical French House that has been forgotten about for since the year 2009. Inside, everything is trapped in time and still in a state like the day it got abandoned was yesterday. For the past Century this charming home had been in the ownership of the Family Vieren, A typical French Family who lived a very modest lifestyle. Misses Vieren was the last inhabitant who sadly passed away, leaving it dormant. The frozen rooms in this place tell novels about former times and are a gateway into their past lives. Unfortunately French Property taxes are too high in comparison to the home prices, that why nobody ever bothered to give this place a new life. Come with us on this adventure through their charming estate and let’s uncover their life story. <br /><br /><br />SOCIALS:<br />Instagram ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/brosofdecay/">https://www.instagram.com/brosofdecay/</a><br />Facebook ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Brothersofdecay/">https://www.facebook.com/Brothersofdecay/</a><br />Twitter ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/brosofdecay">https://twitter.com/brosofdecay</a><br /><br />Abandoned House Abandoned Mansion Urbex Exploring{% endraw %}
