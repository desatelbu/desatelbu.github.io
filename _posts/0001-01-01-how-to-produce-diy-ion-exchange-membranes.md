{% raw %}This video is the full comprehensive guide on a new process to produce highly chemically resistant membranes for use in electrochemistry applications such as producing acids or various transition metal salts from alkali salts.<br />for softer applications like fuel cells you do not need to use the PVC glue and directly apply PVA and citric on fresh cloth.<br />In terms of chemical resistance membranes seem to reach their limit when preparing HClO4 via NaClO4 but can easily prepare Cu(ClO4)2 from NaClO4 using copper anodes.<br />Other substrates such as fiberglass resin may provide better chemical resistance to prepare perchloric acid.{% endraw %}
