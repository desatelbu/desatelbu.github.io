{% raw %}This scary footage shows two boys playing at the very top of a 22-storey building in the Chinese city of Xianning. The rule is simple: to jump over a gap between the roofs of the top floorâ€™s balconies. <br /><br />Luckily, no one was injured: the witness who filmed the video said he called the local property management, who then sent staff to bring the boys down. <br /><br />The roof door is now locked properly.<br /><br /><br />SUBSCRIBE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/sputnikinternational">https://www.youtube.com/sputnikinternational</a><br /><br />FOLLOW US:<br />Facebook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/SputnikNews">https://www.facebook.com/SputnikNews</a><br />Twitter <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/SputnikInt">https://twitter.com/SputnikInt</a><br />Instagram <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/sputnik_news">https://instagram.com/sputnik_news</a><br />TikTok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sputnik_news">https://www.tiktok.com/@sputnik_news</a><br />Soundcloud <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/radiosputnik">https://soundcloud.com/radiosputnik</a><br /><br />Sputnik is a major news media brand with modern multimedia centers in dozens of countries.
