Most people who do end up at a lower body fat percentage typically regain body fat pretty quickly. In other words, they didn’t create a sustainable lifestyle where they can maintain a physique that’s at 10 - 15% body fat.<br /><br />In this video, I share the biggest lessons I’ve learned from maintaining a lean physique between 10 - 15% body fat for over 8 years. These are things that I wish someone told me earlier on my journey as it would have helped a lot. The goal of this video is to teach you to think like a lean person. This way you can not only get a lean physique but most importantly you can maintain a lean physique at a sustainable body fat level for you. That could be getting to 12% body fat, 15% body fat, or whatever level fits your lifestyle long-term.<br /><br />About Me:<br />My name is Mario Tomic. I specialize in helping busy entrepreneurs and professionals get their ideal physique in the most efficient way possible and turn it into a lifestyle long-term.<br /><br />Since 2011, I've spent over 10 000 hours practicing, studying, and coaching fitness, nutrition, and high performance.<br /><br />Most people don't know that my native language is Croatian and that I worked in computer science before I started my fitness and personal development coaching company.<br /><br />#lean #bodyfat #fitness<br /><br />Disclaimer: Mario Tomic is not a doctor or a medical professional.
