{% raw %}Don't Do Shadow Work if You Don't Plan on Actually Making Changes  <br />Shadow work is a really powerful tool, but if you don't plan on actually making changes, don't do shadow work. <br /><br />By this point, you have already heard of shadow work. To sum it up in a neat little package, shadow work is the practice of becoming conscious of the unconscious aspects within you. This integration of unconsciousness ultimately leads to complete and total awareness. Shadow work is absolutely essential if you want to be an integrated person, if you want to actualize your personal power, if you want to walk the earth without fear, if you want to step into a place of free will instead of determinism, if you want to become awakened, if you want to know yourself, if you want to create the life you want in reality, if you want to end your suffering and/or the suffering in the world and the list goes on and on. To understand more about this, you can watch two of my videos. The first is: What is Shadow Work?. The second is: What are the Benefits of Shadow Work. Ultimately, shadow work is my specialty. For this reason, what I am about to say is something that you should take very, very seriously: Do not do shadow work if you don’t plan on actually making a change. <br /><br />Full Article here ⟶ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tealswan.com/resources/articles/shadow-work-change/">https://tealswan.com/resources/articles/shadow-work-change/</a><br /><br />Five FREE Guided Meditations by Teal to Support Your Journey:<br />╰ Get Instant Access: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tealswan.net/present">https://www.tealswan.net/present</a><br /><br />Get Support on your Journey with Teal's Spiritual Tools, Frequencies, Meditations and More:<br />╰ Official Shop click here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tealswan.vip/Shop">https://tealswan.vip/Shop</a><br /><br />Dive Deeper and Access ALL of Teal's Exclusive Content, Daily Updates, Workshop Replays &amp; More:<br />╰ Premium Content click here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tealswan.vip/Premium">https://tealswan.vip/Premium</a><br /><br />#lawofattraction #spirituality #awakening<br /> <br />If you are in a crisis or if you or any other person may be feeling suicidal or in danger, the following<br />resources can provide you with immediate help: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tealswan.vip/Help">https://tealswan.vip/Help</a><br /><br />Beginning Song:<br />Alchemy - Blake Dyer<br />www.sundyer.com<br /><br />Ending Song<br />Our Game - Yaima<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://spoti.fi/35ZR6JY">https://spoti.fi/35ZR6JY</a><br /><br />Teal Swan is a bestselling Author and international Speaker.
