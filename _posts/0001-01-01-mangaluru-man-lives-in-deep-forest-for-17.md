{% raw %}Now a days we cannot think of staying away from the internet, social media apps etc. We are so used to it that moving away from these things seems like a daunting task. However, 56-year-old Chandrashekar might be able to change your point of view on this.<br />Between the villages of Adtale and Nekkare in the Dakshina Kannada district is located a dense forest where Chandrashekar resides. Away from the city life and all the civilisation, he took shelter in nature. If you want to reach him then you will have to walk 3-4 kilometres through the jungle and soon you will be able to see plastic sheets resting on bamboo sticks from far away.Besides the small tent, you will find an old ambassador car, white in colour with a radio thatâ€™s the only functional thing inside it. You will also come across Chandrashekar, who now looks lean with strong limbs, half bald, not shaved or had a haircut in years, rubber slippers and who only owns two pairs of clothing.<br /><br />#ShaniKiNotebook<br />#TalhaFilms{% endraw %}
