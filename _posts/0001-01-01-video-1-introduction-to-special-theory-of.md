{% raw %}In this video I have tried to discuss about Events, frame of references, Inertial frames, Galilean Transformation and some drawback of Classical physics. There are some mistakes obviously that you can understand, I hope. There are plenty areas where I have to improve. If you like my videos please share and subscribe. Help us to grow. Constructive Comments, Advices are always welcome.{% endraw %}
