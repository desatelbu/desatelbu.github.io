{% raw %}Witnesses say soldiers in Sudan have shot dead at least five people at a protest demanding an end to military rule. The Qatar-based news network Al Jazeera, which had been covering the demonstrations, says its bureau chief has been arrested. The protests came after the army set up a new ruling council without any civilians on it. It dissolved the country's power-sharing government last month.<br />They came in their thousands in defiance of the military. Across Sudan, the streets filled with calls for democratic rule. <br />Protesters say they were met with violence from security forces firing live bullets. <br />The prime minister is among those detained in the October coup. Demonstrators are demanding a new era in Sudanese politics, as the military tightens its grip.<br />Police deny firing at the demonstrators. But the injuries at hospitals and witness statements say otherwise. It's a sacrifice some see as necessary in Sudan's long struggle for democracy.<br /><br /><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />For more news go to: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.dw.com/en/">http://www.dw.com/en/</a><br />Follow DW on social media:<br />►Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/">https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/</a><br />►Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/dwnews">https://twitter.com/dwnews</a><br />►Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/dwnews">https://www.instagram.com/dwnews</a><br />Für Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch">https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch</a><br /><br /><br />#Sudan #Protest #MilitaryCoup{% endraw %}
