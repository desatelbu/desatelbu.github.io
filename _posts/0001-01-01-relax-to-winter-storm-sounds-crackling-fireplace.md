{% raw %}It's time to relax! A winter wind blows through a snowy forest while you keep warm by the crackling fire. Cuddle up under a cozy blanket, grab a good book and let go of stress as you listen to the windy storm sounds and relaxing fireplace ambience. As you spend time with loved ones and put aside work and other worries, the stress begins to fade away. The white noise from the winter storm helps block out distractions while you enjoy a moment of relaxation. In addition, the crackling fireplace sound adds a calming ambience. If setting a relaxing mood for sleep, this 10 hour video will continue playing all night long.<br /><br />What are your favorite winter memories?<br /><br />For more crackling fireplace or Arctic windstorm sounds, please check out:<br />Fireplace with Crackling Flames &amp; Glowing Embers: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/hvMw3Oc9RRk">https://youtu.be/hvMw3Oc9RRk</a><br />Winter Storm White Noise: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/x7uiFDbV8us">https://youtu.be/x7uiFDbV8us</a><br />Fireplace Burning Sounds: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/K0pJRo0XU8s">https://youtu.be/K0pJRo0XU8s</a><br /><br />#WinterStorm #Relaxation #RelaxingSounds #Fireplace #WhiteNoise #RelaxingWhiteNoise #Vibes #FireplaceSounds #Fire #Winter #WindSounds<br /><br />***<br /><br />Relaxing White Noise is the number one destination on YouTube for white noise and nature sounds to help you sleep, study or soothe a crying baby.<br /><br />Please subscribe to our channel for more relaxing sounds: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/relaxingwhitenoise">https://www.youtube.com/relaxingwhitenoise</a><br /><br />Check out the Relaxing White Noise Podcast!<br />Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/show/2bAmrw0xKnOhOx4hqSL7vF">https://open.spotify.com/show/2bAmrw0xKnOhOx4hqSL7vF</a><br />Apple: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/relaxing-white-noise/id1525750966?uo=4">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/relaxing-white-noise/id1525750966?uo=4</a><br /><br />DISCLAIMER:<br /><br />Remember that loud sounds can potentially damage your hearing.
