{% raw %}Brush brush brush! It's important to brush our teeth to keep our smiles clean and healthy. Caitie is exploring just how important it is with an interesting experiment that can show what might happen if we don't brush our teeth! We'll also take a trip to Caitie's dentist, practice brushing our teeth with a fun song, and brush away germs with a simple craft. Let's see your beautiful and healthy smiles! <br /><br />Did you know? You can follow along with the activities at home with the help of Caitie's show notes! The show notes include tips for recreating the classroom activities and ideas to expand on them for more learning and fun.
