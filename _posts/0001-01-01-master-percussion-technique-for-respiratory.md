{% raw %}Master Percussion Technique For Respiratory Clinical Examination - Clinical SKills - Dr Gill<br /><br />Percussion of the respiratory system is one of the earliest techniques learnt at medical school, and without a doubt percussion of the chest is almost certainly going to cause issues for the medical student when this is first attempted<br /><br />Percussion for the lungs is one of THE core clinical techniques, as will be a vital part of any respiratory clinical examination<br /><br />Percussion will allow medical students to determine if there is consolidation, from a collapse, or infection due to a dull percussion note. A highly resonant percussion note may indicate a pneumothorax or trapping of air<br /><br />We can combine this information with data from auscultation to be able to make the diagnosis of conditions such as a pleural effusion<br /><br />#Percussion #RespiratoryExamination #DrGill #ClinicalSkills{% endraw %}
