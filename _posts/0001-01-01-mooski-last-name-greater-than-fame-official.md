He’s is now seeing the change that fame brings to people and things around him. “ It ain’t bout the fame it’s more bout the last name”....<br /><br />Lyrics: <br />Alabama Nigga with a dream, turned the city up<br />On my way, I just left Gitty Up<br />Fillin’ up whip we bout to drive...to see my mom she keep me lifted up <br />Cause I wake up some days don’t feel like gettin’ up<br />A hundred missed calls I don’t feel like pickin’ up <br />Plus a Nigga barley sleep<br />My girl say I need to eat<br />Depression I need victory<br />Everybody sayin’ that they prayin’ for me<br />God protect me from all my enemies, that I can’t see<br />(I can’t even trust their prayers no more) <br />So please don’t pray for me<br />Cause it’s a thin line, it’s a thin line <br />I got a Cartier but I can’t spend time, tryin’ to control things, cause the victory been mine...<br /><br />Lord I’m broken I need healing <br />Sinning, I just ask for forgiveness <br />On these addys got me up in my feelings<br />And I know I need to change how I’m livin’<br />I still believe in God auntie hear me <br />Spiritual not Religious (I don’t need a church just to talk to my God)<br />I’m just venting, I’m just venting<br />Don’t tell me I’m trippin, I ain’t trippin <br />The world need to hear the real, the world need to hear it <br />The world need to feel the real, the world need to feel it<br />Cause everybody hurtin’ and everybody workin’<br />And everybody walkin round like they perfect <br />Like everything perfectly fine<br />Know you got that hurt on your mind<br />Then your heart, then your heart get real heavy<br />When them tears finally start to roll, they’ll break the levy <br />And they keep going, and they keep going, and they keep rolling<br />But this a take it to the head shot<br />Another victim of that henny red dot, <br />Yes I, drink myself to sleep til I’m a dead guy <br />Everytime, I ask myself why my dad died <br />Life happens to us all sometimes we all fall<br />I pray we all get back up and may we all ball <br />Big bag know they big mad I just got in it<br />Back of the Cadillac, black on black, and the windows all tinted <br />Money can’t buy happiness that’s facts, but you gone spend it<br />Money can’t change everyone that’s whack, but that’s what you gone witness <br />It ain’t bout the fame, it’s more bout the last name<br />Why hate a Nigga who tryna change how his family live?{% endraw %}
