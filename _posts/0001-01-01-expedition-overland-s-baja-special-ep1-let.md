{% raw %}Join the Expedition Overland team on an all new adventure as they prepare to head South, way South, to Baja, Mexico! Many of the team members have never been and it's time for a deep dive into all Baja has to offer. Great people, vibrant culture, epic beaches, off-roading, and of course, tacos! <br />The team gets ready with some familiar faces from @Epic Family Road Trip as well as some 'seasoned' XO members. The crew prepares the Tundra, Tacoma, and an old friend, the Clone 4Runner from Toyota. You won't want to miss all 5 episodes of this epic adventure as this team has no idea what they're in for... #xoverland #bajaspecial #anywhereispossible<br /><br />P.S.
