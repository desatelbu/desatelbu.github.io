{% raw %}The mission of vocal symphony is to spread happiness through music. <br />We create all the songs, soundtracks, and instruments ourselves so that people can enjoy them anytime they want! It's our goal to provide an outlet for everyone who feels alone or uninspired. <br />Our hope is that you will use this as a form of self-expression and find comfort in our music.{% endraw %}
