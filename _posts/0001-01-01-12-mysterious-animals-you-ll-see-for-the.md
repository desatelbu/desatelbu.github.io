{% raw %}Animals are all around us. With zoos and sections of the media dedicated to animals, we tend to think we’ve seen every type of animal there is! But that’s where we’re wrong. From a stick that just so happens to be alive, a moth that you’ll want to pet, to an animal that will make you do an instant double-take, here are 12 mysterious animals you’ll see for the first time in your life! <br /><br />► Subscribe For New Videos! ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/XPOHAZ">https://goo.gl/XPOHAZ</a><br /><br />Watch our “20 Sea Animals Who Messed With The Wrong Opponent,”<br />video here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/qQoR2YUawdk">https://youtu.be/qQoR2YUawdk</a><br />Watch our “10 Scariest Shark Species You’ve Never Heard Of”<br />video here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/GMxYYa01joM">https://youtu.be/GMxYYa01joM</a><br />Watch our “15 Animals Who Eat Their Own Kind!”<br />video here:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/3HGXQqgYXpQ">https://youtu.be/3HGXQqgYXpQ</a><br /><br />Shoebill<br /><br />All birds we have around us today are the descendants of dinosaurs, even if they don’t really look like it. But with this bird, no DNA tests are necessary, just look at it! This is a shoebill. The name is quite literal because these are essentially storks, but instead of having a “regular” stork beak, these have a bill that’s abnormally large, and shaped like a shoe! This bird can grow up to a massive 5 feet in height, which just adds to the overall scariness they’re associated with! But that stereotype isn’t for no reason, it’s kind of well deserved! <br /><br />These birds are incredible predators with anger issues, so if you do anything that rubs them the wrong way, they’re going to come after you! They’re so aggressive that they’ve even been seen striking young crocodiles! The good thing is, Shoebills usually don’t attack humans, but they will stare you down in a very intimidating way if they don’t want you to be somewhere! <br /><br />Stick Insect <br /><br />There are two types of people in the world, those that see insects as totally harmless creatures, and those that run far away at the sheer sight of one. What if you couldn’t even see the insect until it was crawling all over you? Well, that’s exactly the way this master of disguise insect works! The stick insect looks exactly like a stick, even if you’ve got it super up close to your face! <br /><br />The only giveaway is that they’re, well, alive and that they have antennas at the front of their heads! You might’ve actually even seen one of these, but not realized it, because they blend in perfectly with their environment. These insects are a true marvel of nature. <br /><br /><br />Follow Us On Social Media <br /><br /><br /><br />Twitter <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/FactsJunkieYT">https://twitter.com/FactsJunkieYT</a><br /><br />Facebook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/FactsJunkieYT">https://www.facebook.com/FactsJunkieYT</a><br /><br /><br /><br />► For copyright issues, send us an email at: factsjunkie@gmail.com{% endraw %}
