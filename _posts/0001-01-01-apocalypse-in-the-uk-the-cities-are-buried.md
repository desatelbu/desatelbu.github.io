{% raw %}More than 9,200 homes were left without electricity due to significant damage from Storm Arwen last week, when winds blew in the UK at more than 80 mph. People leave vehicles at home due to snowfall. Northern Powergrid said it has restored power to 234,900 of the 240,000 customers who lost power. Likewise, Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks said it has restored electricity to 130,000 customers, adding that only 950 customers were left without electricity. Despite the progress made, the Energy Grid Association reported that 9,200 homes were without electricity - 1,300 in the northwest of England and 1,250 in Scotland. Some parts of the UK are expected to experience more snowfall as temperatures may drop. Snow is expected in the mountains of Wales and in the north. Low temperatures are likely in many parts of the UK, including central and western Scotland, where temperatures can drop below freezing but can get much colder due to strong winds. The Weather Bureau forecaster said snow, hail and storms were expected, but added that conditions would improve by evening: “It is snowing now in the north and east of Scotland and in the far north of the Pennines,” he said.{% endraw %}
