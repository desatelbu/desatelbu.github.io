{% raw %}PepsiCo has received the permit for the installation of a Tesla Semi Megacharger at its Modesto, California, facility, according to public documents released by Stanislaus County and first shared by @MarcoRPTesla.<br /><br />PepsiCo. will be the first company to receive Tesla Semi trucks. It was in March 2021 when we learned that Tesla Semi will make 15-vehicle debut with PepsiCo at the end of this year. <br /><br />In order for these things to materialize the first one of the first things we should see is a permit to install a Megacharger for a Tesla Semi. Unless there is a permit to build or install megachargers for Tesla Semi trucks, all the conversations about the production and deliveries of Tesla Semis are vain.<br /><br />Now, we are learning that the Stanislaus County Planning Commission officially issued a permit for the Megacharger installation yesterday on November 22nd, the documents show. &quot;PepsiCo. has been attempting to receive installation privileges since April, when it initially submitted the application on April 21st. The Planning Commission has performed regular inspections, including a Fire review, in the months between the submittal of the application and the issuance of the permit. The permit approval was first shared by @MarcoRPTesla,&quot; reports Teslarati.<br /><br />You know, the Tesla Semi is just as important as the Model 3. Commercial trucking isnâ€™t going away and we have got to make them safer and far more energy efficient. Therefore, it is very important and exciting to see them on the road.<br /><br />#TeslaSemi<br />#Tesla<br />#PepsiCo<br /><br />PepsiCo and Tesla Semi supercharger installation. Pepsico and Tesla.
