{% raw %}What an interesting secret! I honestly wouldn't have expected anything like this coming out of the Whitty mod, I wonder if it's a teaser for something bigger..?  The character looks super interesting, I'd love to see him interacting with Whitty in the future, if that's ever a possibility! He's got such a cool character design and seems like the complete polar opposite of Whitty, I feel like that'd create some pretty cool interactions with them both! I loved the song as well, it was very nice to listen to! The effects added onto it looked suuuper cool as well, I really enjoyed this little secret, I hope it gets expanded on in the future! Hope you guys enjoy!<br /><br />Link to mod: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/44214">https://gamebanana.com/mods/44214</a><br /><br /><br />Join this FNF Leaderboards Discord if you want to see actually good players! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/pSnB7ExjEp">https://discord.gg/pSnB7ExjEp</a><br /><br />Support the developers!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/funkin/friday-night-funkin-the-full-ass-game/">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/funkin/friday-night-funkin-the-full-ass-game/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ninja-muffin24.itch.io/funkin">https://ninja-muffin24.itch.io/funkin</a>{% endraw %}
