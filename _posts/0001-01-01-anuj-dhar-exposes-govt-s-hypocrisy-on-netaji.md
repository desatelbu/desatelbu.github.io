{% raw %}Anuj Dhar is an Indian author (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.in/Anuj-Dhar/e/B001ICN7QI/),">https://www.amazon.in/Anuj-Dhar/e/B001ICN7QI/),</a> activist and former journalist. He has published several books around the locus of death of Subhas Chandra Bose that focus on his' living for several years after the purported plane crash. Dhar is also the founder-trustee of a not for profit organisation, Mission Netaji, which campaigns for the declassification of documents concerning Bose. <br /><br />In 2005, the Taiwan government provided emails to Dhar that it has no records of a plane crash during the period of 14 August to 25 October 1945, at the old Matsuyama Airport (now Taipei Domestic Airport). These records played a major role in the final assertion of Mukherjee Commission about the implausibility of Bose dying from an air crash. <br /><br />Apart from Netaji's mystery, Anuj Dhar has delved in to finding the real reason behind the death of the then Indian PM. Sri Lal Bahadur Shastri's mysterious death in Tashkent. He has authored a book on the same. #ShastriDeath #Netaji #GumnamiBaba <br /><br />क्या मोदी, क्या नेहरू, क्या इंदिरा गाँधी... कोई भी सरकार नेताजी या शास्त्री जी की संदिग्ध मृत्यु का सच सामने नहीं लाना चाहती। लेखक एवं एक्टिविस्ट अनुज धर बता रहें हैं क्यों जरुरी है इन मुद्दों पर सकारों की चुप्पी और क्या है सच जो उन्हें शोध के दौरान प्रत्यक्ष मिले।<br />--<br />If You liked the Video, Kindly Support Us: <br />Paytm/PhonePe/Google: 7303069286<br />BHIM/UPI: 7303069286@paytm  <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/dopolitics">https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/dopolitics</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/DOpolitics​">https://www.patreon.com/DOpolitics​</a><br />-<br />Follow us on our social media channels :<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.fb.com/DOpolitics.in">https://www.fb.com/DOpolitics.in</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/DOpolitics_in">https://www.twitter.com/DOpolitics_in</a><br />Insta: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.Instagram.com/DOpolitics">https://www.Instagram.com/DOpolitics</a><br />Koo: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.kooapp.com/profile/dopolitics">https://www.kooapp.com/profile/dopolitics</a><br />Telegram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.t.me/DOpolitics">https://www.t.me/DOpolitics</a><br /><br />---<br />DO Politics is a digital newsroom which aims to fill the absence of unbiased, un-yelling news service.
