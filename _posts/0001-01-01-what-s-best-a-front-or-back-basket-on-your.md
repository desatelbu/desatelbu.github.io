{% raw %}The eternal bike question, finally answered! Having used both front and back baskets on my bike over the years, I've mused about the pros and cons of each style a lot. So I decided to finally put a little rigor to those musings and did a series of tests to detemine if it's better in your urban bike life or bicycle commute to haul your stuff in a basket on the front of your bike, or the back. Here are the tests:<br /><br />0:00 Introduction<br />1:02 The empty basket test<br />2:09 The grocery test<br />4:50 The weight test<br />7:04 The convenience test<br />7:53 The bounce test<br />9:05 The conclusion<br /><br />Here's the baskets I used in the video:<br /><br />Front: Evo Bar Basket Classic <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3k1TIAm">https://amzn.to/3k1TIAm</a><br />Rear: Axiom Market Basket LX <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3l5onMk">https://amzn.to/3l5onMk</a><br /><br />To support this channel, please subscribe, share this video and check out the links below. <br />• Buy my book Frostbike: The Joy, Pain and Numbness of Winter Cycling: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3lxJiHT">https://amzn.to/3lxJiHT</a><br />• Here's the winter bike I'm riding these days: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2PhqUqF">https://bit.ly/2PhqUqF</a><br />• Love these pants for cycling without looking like a cyclist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3eH1Io5">https://bit.ly/3eH1Io5</a><br />• Epidemic Sound for music.
