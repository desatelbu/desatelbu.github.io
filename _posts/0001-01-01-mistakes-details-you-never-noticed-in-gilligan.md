Some of those things are mistakes made during filming, like visible backdrops behind the set or prop people being visible in scenes.<br />There are also goofs that would have made it hard to pinpoint exactly where Gilligan’s Island was for anyone searching for the castaways. For example, two different coordinates were given for the island in different episodes. And the Professor wasn’t very clear in one of them, making their chances of rescue a lot less likely.<br /><br />There were also a lot of little details that would be easy to miss on casual viewing. For example, the first episode included a scene with actors from the original pilot that wasn’t in the show when it officially premiered. And while several of the characters were known by one name or their nickname, like Gilligan and the Skipper, some of those names were mentioned briefly in the first episode.<br /><br />In this video, we’ll look at some of the biggest goofs that happened over the three seasons of Gilligan’s Island as well as a bunch of small details that most people probably never noticed. Next time you watch the show, you’ll have something new to watch for!<br /><br />We post new videos regularly so be sure to like and subscribe to the Facts Verse channel to be sure you don’t miss any of our upcoming topics.<br /><br />Mistakes &amp; Details You Never Noticed in Gilligan’s Island{% endraw %}
