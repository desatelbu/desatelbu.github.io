{% raw %}In this video I explain how I select cymbals for playing Jazz.<br />I talk about cymbal hum, thickness, size, mixing and matching brands as well as some alternatives to the old K's that everyone covets.<br />The kit I am using is a Gretsch Catalina Elite set from the early 1990's. I use this as my portable practice kit.<br />The sizes are:<br />16&quot; BD, 12&quot; and 14&quot; toms and a Slingerland Brass 12&quot; x 6.5 &quot; snare.<br />The cymbals I demonstrate in the video are:<br />21&quot; 1940's K Zildjian 2200 Grams<br />21&quot; Istanbul Special Edition Jazz Ride 2150 Grams<br />18&quot; 1950's K Zildjian 1550 Grams<br />15&quot; 1950's K Zildjian Hi Hats Top 700 grams/Bottom 1000 grams<br />13&quot; Sabian HH Regular Hi Hats Top 620 grams/ Bottom 840 grams<br /><br />I am using 2 Sennheiser MKH 80 Microphones for overheads and a AKG D112 on the Bass Drum{% endraw %}
