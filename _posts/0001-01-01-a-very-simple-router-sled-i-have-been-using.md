{% raw %}I have been using a very simple router sled. <br />It is really simple, convenient and cheap.<br />You just need only 4 linear rails, 8 bearing blocks. <br />And some bolts and plywood.<br />SBR 20 : 1850mm, 2pcs<br />SBR 20 : 1200mm, 2pcs<br />SBR 20UU : 8pcs<br />They cost USD135.21. And I needed some bolts and plywood for the setting.<br /><br />I was using a 20mm router bit for flattening wood. <br />But that is a little bit small for flattening work.<br />So I got a new one from China.<br />It is great.  <br />ENJOY THIS!!{% endraw %}
