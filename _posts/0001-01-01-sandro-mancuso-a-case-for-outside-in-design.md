{% raw %}Avanscoperta presents: An Evening with... Sandro Mancuso<br />&quot;A Case for Outside-In Design&quot; <br /><br />&quot;For a few decades, one of the most common approaches to software design is to first focus on the domain model (application layer), then persistence (data layer) and finally the user interface (presentation layer). But what are the pros and cons of this approach? Are there other alternatives? Are they viable?<br /><br />In this presentation, Sandro will be talking about different design biases and the impact they have. He will then focus on Outside-In Design, explaining how our domain model can emerge and evolve when driven by the needs of external systems or users, avoiding speculation and wasted effort.&quot;<br /><br />(This meetup was recorded at MikaMai/LinkMe, Milan, Thursday 28th February 2019)<br /><br />Interested in TDD, software design and software development?
