{% raw %}&quot;Time is a critical issue: some things seem too far away or too long ago to be difficult and to have no lessons for us in the present, crusades and massacres is one example that we might sight there. Some things seem too close and too raw to be dealt with, such as the Srebrenica massacre for example. How might we deal with these as recent hot memory, not just news but something that can actually be understood and apprehended in a museum?&quot;{% endraw %}
