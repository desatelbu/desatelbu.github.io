{% raw %}China has banned wax apples and sugar apples from Taiwan, saying they contain &quot;dangerous&quot; pests. This comes after rumors that the Biden administration is considering a name change for Taiwan's unofficial embassy in Washington that would include &quot;Taiwan.&quot; The connection? China considers Taiwan a province of the mainland despite it being independently ruled for decades, and has tried to get other countries to end diplomatic relations with it. Even using the name &quot;Taiwan&quot; is seen as a threat to Beijing, which is why Taiwanese athletes compete at the Olympics under the name &quot;Chinese Taipei.&quot; Watch this episode of China Uncensored for more on what Taiwan plans to do, what happened when China did something similar with pineapples, and what other countries are doing to help Taiwan. <br /><br />YouTube demonetizes our channels, we need your support!<br />patreon.com/ChinaUncensored<br />chinauncensored.locals.com<br /><br />We also accept bitcoin!<br />chinauncensored.tv/bitcoin<br /><br />Make sure to share this video with your friends!<br />______________________________<br />Subscribe for updates:<br />youtube.com/ChinaUncensored?sub_confirmation=1<br /><br />______________________________<br />Twitter: twitter.com/ChinaUncensored<br />Facebook: facebook.com/ChinaUncensored<br />Instagram: instagram.com/ChinaUncensored<br /><br />And check out the China Unscripted podcast!<br />youtube.com/chinaunscripted<br />______________________________<br />© All Rights Reserved.{% endraw %}
