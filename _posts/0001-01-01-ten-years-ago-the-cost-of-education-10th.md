{% raw %}To mark Economic Update's 10th anniversary year, Professor Wolff is revisiting relevant moments from 10 years ago to explore how capitalism, its defenders, and its critics have all changed.<br /><br />For the month of September, Prof Wolff takes a look at the rising cost of education in the US.<br /><br />&quot;We're not doing what the Germans do. We're charging an arm and a leg for higher education. We're not pouring money into universities and constructing them. We're seeing them close. We're seeing them stop various programs. We're seeing them in endless budgetary distress, unlike the people's republic of China. The United States, it could be argued, is literally undercutting its own future, shooting itself in the foot by this crazy notion that we can charge whatever we want for higher education and either the students won't go or will burden them with debt that will distort their life choices for years afterwards.&quot; - Richard Wolff<br /><br />Producing Economic Update has always depended on audience donations to the non-profit Democracy at Work.
