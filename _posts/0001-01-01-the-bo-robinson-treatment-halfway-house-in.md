{% raw %}This video is pre police video with several staff members of the bo Robinson center in Trenton asking whatâ€™s going on and demanding identification on public property.  The business manager believes the sidewalk is owned by the building.  We have seriously question what is going on at this treatment facility if this is how they treat free citizens.{% endraw %}
