Without your support, Two Funny Mamas wouldn't be where its at. Gather 'round for a LIVE Holiday hangout with the ladies. <br /><br />Kym's product store: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://whitleyproducts.store/index.html">http://whitleyproducts.store/index.html</a><br />TFM merch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://byjack.com/twofunnymamas">http://byjack.com/twofunnymamas</a><br /><br />Two Funny Mamas is hosted by Emmy Award winning host, comic, actress and New York Times best-selling author Sherri Shepherd and host, comic, Emmy Award winning actress and author Kym Whitley.  As powerhouse comediennes and longtime friends, Sherri and Kym have been making each other - and audiences around the world - laugh for more than 25 years. The duo joined forces in stand-up for their Ladies Night Out comedy tour, which played to sold out theaters and arenas across the country. Also, to the delight of their fans, since 2015, Sherri and Kym have shared their love of laughter as co-hosts of the #1 R&amp;B syndicated radio program, “The Tom Joyner Morning Show.”<br /><br />Sherri and Kym are once again blending their comedic power to deliver a podcast that speaks to culture, sisterhood, moms and working women everywhere. Nothing is off limits when these two funny ladies get together to talk about life, love, motherhood, singleness, relationships, dating, pop culture, sex [or the lack thereof!] and everything in between. Raw, unfiltered and funny.  That's what audiences can expect when Two Funny Mamas, Sherri and Kym, get on the mic!<br /><br />Follow Sherri Shepherd:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/OfficialSherriShepherd/">https://facebook.com/OfficialSherriShepherd/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/sherrieshepherd">https://instagram.com/sherrieshepherd</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/SherriEShepherd">https://twitter.com/SherriEShepherd</a><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://sherrishepherd.com/">http://sherrishepherd.com/</a><br /><br />Follow Kym Whitley:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/kymwhitley">https://facebook.com/kymwhitley</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/kymwhitley/">https://instagram.com/kymwhitley/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/kymwhitley">https://twitter.com/kymwhitley</a><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://iamkymwhitley.com/">https://iamkymwhitley.com/</a><br /><br />About Sherri Shepherd:<br />Equal parts actress, comedian, host, producer, author, and entrepreneur, there’s no denying Sherri Shepherd is one of entertainment’s most diversified and flat-out funny performers. Currently starring alongside Gabriel Iglesias in the Netflix comedy “Mr. Iglesias,” Sherri also serves as a weekly co-host of “The Tom Joyner Morning Show” and Fox’s “Dish Nation.” Sherri’s dramatic turn as Leomia Banks in the film “Brian Banks” - as the mother to a 16 year accused of a crime he didn’t commit - received critical acclaim. No stranger to daytime TV, her role as co-host of “The View” during Seasons 11-17 helped earn the talk show its only Daytime Emmy.<br /><br />Sherri has appeared on “How I Met Your Mother,” “Everybody Loves Raymond,” “Man with a Plan,” “The Jamie Foxx Show,” “Soul Man,” “30 Rock,” “Abducted: The Carlina White Story,” “One for the Money,” Chris Rock’s “Top Five,” “Precious,” “Woodlawn,” “Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa,” “Guess Who,” “Who’s Your Caddy,” “Beauty Shop” and “Ride Along 2” with Kevin Hart. Sherri also produced and starred in her own sitcom, “SHERRI” for Lifetime and co-hosted five successful seasons of the classic game show “The Newlywed Game.”<br /><br />Sherri is author of the New York Times Best Seller “PLAN D: How to Lose Weight and Beat Diabetes Even If You Don’t Have It” [<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3bdEqS2]">https://amzn.to/3bdEqS2]</a> and humorous autobiography, “Permission Slips: Every Woman’s Guide to Giving Yourself a Break” [<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2VPThvJ].">https://amzn.to/2VPThvJ].</a><br /><br />Beyond the business, Shepherd deems motherhood as her greatest accomplishment. “My most important assignment is my 14 year old son, Jeffrey.”<br /> <br />About Kym Whitley:<br />These days, the majority of people know Kym Whitley either from her frequent appearances on Larry David’s groundbreaking HBO series “Curb Your Enthusiasm” or from “The Tom Joyner Morning Show.” But that’s only the tip of the iceberg. Kym is actually a comedienne, actress, activist, author and — perhaps most importantly — a mother.<br /><br />She got her start in the Shelley Garrett play “Beauty Shop,” which started in L.A. and wound up doing a national tour. Her TV career took off during the mid-to-late ‘90s. Kym has appeared in “Married with Children,” “Moesha,” “The Wayans Brothers Show,” “’Til Death,” “Meet The Browns,” “Animal Practice,” “Two Broke Girls,” “The Bay,” “Young &amp; Hungry” and “Twenties” (among others). Kym is also no stranger to the big screen. She’s appeared in “Next Friday,” “The Nutty Professor,” “Along Came Polly,” “College Road Trip,” “I Love You Man,” “Something Like A Business,” “Delivery Us From Eva,” “Fist Fight,” and dozens of other films.  She also voiced the character Melonee in 2011’s “Rango.”{% endraw %}
