{% raw %}Do it yourself Pocket Wedding Invitation! Very easy to do! If you have a lot to make, get your bridesmaids involved! <br /><br />All supplies were purchased at either Michael's or JoAnn's.  All in the scrapbooking section.<br /><br />I received some questions regarding the envelopes used! I used the website www.envelopes.com. It is great because you can order samples before you buy everything you need.  The wedding invitation envelope is in the size A7, the RSVP card envelope size is A1. <br /><br />I recommend that you use the website www.retailmenot.com before purchasing supplies... this website always has coupons you can use at these stores. Will save you some money! :)<br /><br />Thank you so much for watching and subscribe for weekly videos!<br /><br /><br />Business email: alinaanarr@gmail.com{% endraw %}
