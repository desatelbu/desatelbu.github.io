I wanted to figure out my body type and dress based on the do's and don'ts to determine if clothes are &quot;flattering&quot; on my body type.  Let's find out..<br />thanks for watching. <br /><br />✿ time stamps<br />00:00 intro<br />00:43 body type<br />01:11 first outfit &quot;do&quot;<br />02:06 second outfit &quot;dont&quot;<br />03:10 third outfit &quot;do&quot;<br />04:25 four outfit &quot;dont&quot;<br />05:35 fifth outfit &quot;do&quot;<br />06:26 sixth outfit &quot;dont&quot;<br />07:27 seventh outfit &quot;do&quot;<br />08:30 eighth outfit &quot;dont&quot;<br />09:32 history of fashion<br />11:28 define &quot;flattering&quot; <br />12:13 pros of dressing for your body type<br />13:21 cons of dressing for your body type<br />16:31 the will to power/life theory<br />18:08 outro<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />✿  articles/videos:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.racked.com/2016/11/28/13425116/flattering-flaws-body-positivity">https://www.racked.com/2016/11/28/13425116/flattering-flaws-body-positivity</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bustle.com/p/why-bustles-fashion-editors-dont-talk-about-flattering-outfits">https://www.bustle.com/p/why-bustles-fashion-editors-dont-talk-about-flattering-outfits</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2018/10/30/why-i-gave-up-flattering-clothing">https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2018/10/30/why-i-gave-up-flattering-clothing</a><br /><br />the will to power nietzsche:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche/#WillPowe">https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche/#WillPowe</a><br /><br />vids for inspo:<br />Kaiti Yoo<br />&quot;I look bad in everything I wear.&quot; dude, no. you're just not dressing for YOUR body type.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/xxGya7dCqfI">https://youtu.be/xxGya7dCqfI</a><br /><br />YO' HOMEGIRL<br />How to Style an Inverted Triangle, yes girl I gotchu. ✨<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/NXW-aq6eA7w">https://youtu.be/NXW-aq6eA7w</a><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />✿ SOCIAL MEDIA <br />Pinterest: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pinterest.com/karinargomez18/_saved/">https://www.pinterest.com/karinargomez18/_saved/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/livingaskarina">https://www.instagram.com/livingaskarina</a> <br />TikTok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@livingaskarina">https://www.tiktok.com/@livingaskarina</a><br />Business Inquiries: krgomez@g.ucla (dot) edu<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />✿ About me:<br />Hello, I'm Karina.
