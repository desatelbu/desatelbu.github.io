{% raw %}I do not know under what circumstances the falcon was injured. Apparently, the falcon did not have time to fly away from the stray dogs, which suddenly attacked him, focusing on prey.<br />The video shows a peregrine falcon, which was wounded by other predators, left this bird and its fate is unknown to me, he could not fly.<br /><br /><br />#falcon<br />#woundedfalcon<br />#peregrine{% endraw %}
