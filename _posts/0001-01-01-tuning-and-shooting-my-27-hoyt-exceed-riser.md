{% raw %}Finishing up my @Hoyt Archery 27&quot; Exceed Riser and Extra Long Velos Review, I tune and score at 18 Meters. The stability at full draw and the ease of shooting is unparalleled! However there are a few concerns I have and I share them and more in this video. <br /><br />If you have issues on the base of the limb like I did where it contacts the riser and you have the carbon weave in that damaged area, reach out to Hoyt and they should take care of you. <br /><br />Learn to tune your bow like I do: www.jakekaminski.com<br />Tuning Series: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1K0BMILEQQ&amp;list=PLKgJAe7yjDdKqXiwGtAgymRbOXqTLJbYa">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1K0BMILEQQ&amp;list=PLKgJAe7yjDdKqXiwGtAgymRbOXqTLJbYa</a><br /><br />Link to RCore Grips: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rcore.co?aff=5">https://rcore.co?aff=5</a> <br />Use code KAMINSKI at checkout for 10% off!<br /><br />Consider Supporing my Channel <br />YouTube Membership: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYMJYC6hEKaaTXjzK4Y521g/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYMJYC6hEKaaTXjzK4Y521g/join</a><br /><br />Check out my website <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://jakekaminski.com">https://jakekaminski.com</a> for the many ways to support my channel; Books, Apparel, Patreon, Digital Coaching and more!<br /><br />Check out new Apparel: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/jakekaminski">https://teespring.com/stores/jakekaminski</a><br /><br />Support this channel on Patreon: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/jakekaminski">https://www.patreon.com/jakekaminski</a><br /><br />*Send Cool Stuff To:<br />Jake Kaminski<br />P.O.
