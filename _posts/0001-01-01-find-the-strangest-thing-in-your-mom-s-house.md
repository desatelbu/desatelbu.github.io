{% raw %}Moms collect weird things and you really notice it when you go home for the holidays. So we thought it would be fun if this Thanksgiving when you’re back at your parents’ house, you find the strangest thing in there, maybe it’s an empty birdhouse or a ceramic raccoon, and ask your mom to hold it up and explain it. Record her explanation and post it to social media using #MotherClutter. <br /><br />SUBSCRIBE to get the latest #Kimmel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/JKLSubscribe">http://bit.ly/JKLSubscribe</a><br /><br />Watch Mean Tweets: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/KimmelMT10">http://bit.ly/KimmelMT10</a><br /><br />Connect with Jimmy Kimmel Live Online:<br /><br />Visit the Jimmy Kimmel Live WEBSITE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/JKLWebsite">http://bit.ly/JKLWebsite</a><br />Like Jimmy Kimmel on FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/KimmelFB">http://bit.ly/KimmelFB</a><br />Like Jimmy Kimmel Live on FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/JKLFacebook">http://bit.ly/JKLFacebook</a><br />Follow @JimmyKimmel on TWITTER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/KimmelTW">http://bit.ly/KimmelTW</a><br />Follow Jimmy Kimmel Live on TWITTER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/JKLTwitter">http://bit.ly/JKLTwitter</a><br />Follow Jimmy Kimmel Live on INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/JKLInstagram">http://bit.ly/JKLInstagram</a><br /><br />About Jimmy Kimmel Live:<br /><br />Jimmy Kimmel serves as host and executive producer of Emmy®-nominated “Jimmy Kimmel Live!,” ABC’s late-night talk show. “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” is well known for its huge viral video successes, with over 11 billion views and more than 15 million subscribers on the show’s YouTube channel.
