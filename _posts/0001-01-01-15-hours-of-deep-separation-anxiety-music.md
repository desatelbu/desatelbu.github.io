Console whimpering puppies, minimise separation anxiety, reduce hyperactivity, minimise fear of thunderstorms, stop unwanted barking, comfort sick or injured dogs and calm your dog on car journeys - Relax my Dog does it all! <br /><br />Relax My Dog's sound sweep technology is the high pitched noise that runs through a lot of our melodies. Many people believe that dogs hear two to three times more than humans - which isn't true. Actually, dogs hear the same as us - just two to three octaves higher. The sound sweep in our music is designed the same as a dog whistle - to hold your dogs attention to the music.<br /><br />Relax My Dog’s music is unique, and will help in a variety of situations as a substitute for medication. We have helped thousands of dogs and puppies worldwide to sleep and reduce their anxiety. Music therapy for your dog can keep them calm, happy and healthy, and it is a great way to rehabilitate rescue dogs - or just get your puppy or dog used to their new home. <br /><br />Being re-homed is an incredibly stressful time for dogs - as they have to get used to a lot of different sights and sounds, as well as their new family and any other pets in the household. We recommend that you play Relax My Dog during this time, and it will help reduce their heart rate and relax them while they explore their new surroundings. No more whimpering puppies - they will get used to your home in no time at all with the help of Relax My Dog's music!<br /><br />You may be crate training or obedience training, which can be a stressful time for both dog and parent, and our music will soothe your pup making your life easier. Crate training can be one of the hardest things about getting a new puppy - as being trapped in a new space and away from you is very scary for them. However, when listening to Relax My Dog you will notice your puppy start to relax, and get more used to their crate.<br /><br />It is also very useful to calm your dog during car journeys - which many dogs find a stressful time. They may associate it with vets visits - so we recommend playing Relax My Dog's music before and after visits to the vet to reduce their stress.<br /><br />The worst time of year for over 60% of dogs is Firework season - the loud bangs are really scary for them and you may notice a huge change in your dog during this time. Thunderstorms are another difficult time for dogs, with the majority of dogs being very scared of storms because of the unfamiliar loud noises. Relax My Dog is the perfect solution to this anxiety inducing situation - just play our firework and thunderstorm playlist to reduce your dogs anxiety and make them feel safe. <br /><br />The most common problem we hear is separation anxiety in dogs, they are pack animals and see their owners as their pack - being separated from you can cause severe anxiety in many dogs. Relax My Dog’s music has improved thousands of cases of separation anxiety and barking canines all over the world - just play them our music when you leave to go to the shops or out of the room, and you will notice a lot less barking and whimpering from your four-legged friend!<br /><br />So whether you have a Pug, Labrador, Pomeranian, Shi Tzu, Terrier or Great Dane - any breed can become relaxed and calm when listening to Relax My Dog.
