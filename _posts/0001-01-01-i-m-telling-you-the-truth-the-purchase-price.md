{% raw %}The Purchase Price (1932) #WarnerArchive #WarnerBros #ThePurchasePrice<br /><br />Barbara Stanwyck plays a sultry torch singer on the lam in this spicy Pre-Code drama. After getting engaged to a society swell, Joan Gordon promptly quits her nightclub gig and kicks gangster boyfriend Ed Fields (Lyle Talbot) to the curb.

Hiding out in Montreal, Joan hooks up with a naïve farmboy (George Brent) and sets up an arranged marriage. But the plains of North Dakota aren’t big enough to hide a life like Joan’s and Ed soon comes calling.<br /><br />Directed By William A. Wellman<br />Starring Barbara Stanwyck, George Brent, Lyle Talbot<br /><br />Subscribe to watch more Warner Archive videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/warnerarchive?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/c/warnerarchive?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />FOLLOW WARNER ARCHIVE ON SOCIAL<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/warnerarchive">https://www.facebook.com/warnerarchive</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/warnerarchive">https://www.instagram.com/warnerarchive</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/warnerarchive">https://twitter.com/warnerarchive</a><br /><br />ABOUT WARNER ARCHIVE<br />Warner Archive Collection is a branch of Warner Bros home entertainment that releases classic films and TV that were previously unreleased.
