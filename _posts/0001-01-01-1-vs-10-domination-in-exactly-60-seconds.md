{% raw %}1 vs 10 Domination in 60 seconds! This is my video entry for AMDs Last Clip Standing contest.<br /><br />This clip is edited from my original video where I showed the whole round. The editing was surprisingly easy because it took exactly 60 seconds for me to 1 vs 10 the other team! If you liked it please do vote for me! =D<br /><br />And yes my microphone at the time was picking up everything. And yes that is a mechanical keyboard...its loud =X{% endraw %}
