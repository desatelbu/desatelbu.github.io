{% raw %}This video is about how to make a duplicate session in Hypersay.  If you wish to use the same Hypersay session with another audience, you can use our duplicate function in Prepare.  This will create a new session and wipe clean any previous data (responses to questions, questions, comments, feedback, etc.).{% endraw %}
