{% raw %}I believe there are 3 reasons why we use foreground interest in a landscape photography composition. I attempt to illustrate what those reasons are, and shoot some examples on the fantastic Dartmoor in Devon. Unfortunately the weather didn't cooperate, but I think I managed to get enough shots to make this an interesting video with some value for you!<br /><br />If you enjoy photography and filmmaking, specifically outdoor, landscape and travel, then please consider subscribing ðŸ™‚<br /><br />Follow me on INSTAGRAM too:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/simonburncreative/">https://www.instagram.com/simonburncreative/</a><br /><br />#landscapephotography #dartmoor #photographycomposition{% endraw %}
