{% raw %}Lyric Video &quot;Toss A Coin To Your Witcher&quot; from The Witcher (Music from the Netflix Original Series)<br /><br />When a humble bard <br />Graced a ride along <br />With Geralt of Rivia <br />Along came this song<br /><br />From when the White Wolf fought <br />A silver-tongued devil<br />His army of elves<br />At his hooves did they revel<br /><br />They came after me <br />With masterful deceit <br />They broke down my lute and <br />They kicked in my teeth<br /><br />While the devil’s horns <br />Minced our tender meat <br />And so cried the Witcher <br />“He can’t be bleat!”<br /><br />Toss a coin to your Witcher, O Valley of Plenty! O Valley of Plenty!<br />Toss a coin to your Witcher, O Valley of Plenty!<br /><br />At the Edge of the World <br />Fight the mighty horn<br />That bashes and breaks you <br />And brings you to mourn<br /><br />He thrust every elf<br />Far back on the shelf <br />High up on the mountain <br />From whence it came<br /><br />He wiped out your pest <br />Got kicked in his chest <br />He’s a friend of humanity <br />So give him the rest<br /><br />That’s my epic tale<br />Our champion prevailed <br />Defeated the villain <br />Now pour him some ale!<br /><br />Toss a coin to your Witcher, O Valley of Plenty! O Valley of Plenty!<br />Toss a coin to your Witcher, A friend of humanity! <br /><br /><br />► Buy/stream the album here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundtracks.lnk.to/TheWitcher">https://soundtracks.lnk.to/TheWitcher</a><br /><br />International release date: 24 Jan 2020<br /><br />Composers SONYA BELOUSOVA and GIONA OSTINELLI say, “The best part of scoring The Witcher is the constant stream of unlimited creative opportunities this unique and vast universe provides. We wrote and produced songs, folk tunes, dances, and score, collaborated with virtuoso soloists and phenomenal artists, recorded unique historical instruments, many of which were crafted specifically for The Witcher, as well as personally performed and recorded over 60 instruments in order to create over 8 hours of an exciting original soundtrack.”<br /><br />The Witcher tells the story of Geralt of Rivia, a mutated monster-hunter for hire, as he journeys toward his destiny in a turbulent world where people often prove more wicked than beasts.<br /><br /><br />Follow SONY SOUNDTRACKS:<br /><br />► Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/SonyMusicSoundtracks/">https://www.facebook.com/SonyMusicSoundtracks/</a><br /><br />► Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/sonymusicsoundtracks/">https://www.instagram.com/sonymusicsoundtracks/</a><br /><br />► Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/sonysoundtracks/">https://twitter.com/sonysoundtracks/</a><br /><br />► Youtube/VEVO: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SonySoundtracksVEVO">https://www.youtube.com/c/SonySoundtracksVEVO</a><br /><br />#Witcher #Geralt #TossACoin{% endraw %}
