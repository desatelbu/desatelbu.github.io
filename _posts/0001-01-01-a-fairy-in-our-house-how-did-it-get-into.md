{% raw %}how did it get into Adleys room?<br /><br />BELIEVE IN THAT SUBSCRIBE!! --- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/rfgp8V">http://goo.gl/rfgp8V</a><br /><br />Best Fairy Day Ever 864<br /><br />Favorite part of the day is breakfast with Adley! Almost every morning we sit down and have cereal together. We get to talk and laugh and just hung out. Today is extra special because last night Adley was visited by the Binky Fairy! She came and took away all of the binkys to give them to baby who need them, because Adley's a big girl now.<br /><br />But the Binky Fairy left something for Adley, a brand new Kitchen. She loves it. She was so excited to play with it this morning that she woke up super early to play with it. So she gives us a tour of her dream kitchen and then she makes pancakes for the vlog in a unique way. I love watching her play with it!<br /><br />I then head into the Spacestation to give you all an update on the renovations, a warning about our old contractor, and a preview of things that will still happen. <br /><br />Adley Pretend Play New Kitchen Toy Set! --<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/8saxh-j3xGY">https://youtu.be/8saxh-j3xGY</a><br /><br />snag some sweet Spacestation merch --- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shopspacestation.com/">https://shopspacestation.com/</a><br /><br />Find me on any social media @Shonduras!!<br /><br />Music: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/">https://www.epidemicsound.com/</a><br /><br />Here's some stuff we use:<br />Office decked out by our friends at Fully:<br />Desks - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.fully.com/standing-desks/jarvis.html">https://www.fully.com/standing-desks/jarvis.html</a><br />Chairs - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.fully.com/chairs.html">https://www.fully.com/chairs.html</a><br />Camera: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bhpho.to/2whsOwZ">https://bhpho.to/2whsOwZ</a><br />Wide Lens: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bhpho.to/2wh34Rk">https://bhpho.to/2wh34Rk</a><br />Zoom Lens: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bhpho.to/2ydN1ku">https://bhpho.to/2ydN1ku</a><br />JOBY Pod: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bhpho.to/2whIFM2">https://bhpho.to/2whIFM2</a><br />Cool Longboards: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2im9lTo">http://amzn.to/2im9lTo</a><br />Sweet Keyboard: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2g8IM15">http://amzn.to/2g8IM15</a><br />Rad Headsets: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2zkv83L">http://amzn.to/2zkv83L</a><br />Other HyperX Stuff: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.hyperxgaming.com/us">https://www.hyperxgaming.com/us</a><br /><br /><br /><br />*highfive*<br />(leave a highfive in the comments if you read this far){% endraw %}
