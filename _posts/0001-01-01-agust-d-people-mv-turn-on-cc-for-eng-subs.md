{% raw %}[TURN ON CC FOR ENG SUBS + WATCH IN HD!]<br />This is a fanmade music video! Literally I was up at the EXACT time (2 AM IN THE MORNING OMG) Suga dropped his mixtape and this is one of the songs that I really liked so I decided to make a MV for it. Thinking about it, this song is lowkey sad because he talks about and reflects on the people that he's met through his life and how they've changed as he has, Min Yoongi is not Suga, and Suga is not AGUST D.<br /><br />INSTA: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/sandii_yt/">https://www.instagram.com/sandii_yt/</a><br /><br />I do not allow my videos to be reuploaded or reposted on Youtube even with credit, but I will allow my videos to be shared on other sites (ex.
