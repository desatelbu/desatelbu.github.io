However, many players often ask themselves if the trades or exchanges they did are the right decision. Also, when is the ideal time to exchange pieces or pawns? In this series, we want to help you to answer this question yourself by teaching you exchange guidelines that help you to take the right decision. You will learn that every exchange, doesn‚Äôt matter if it is a pawn or piece exchange, can be seen as a strategic decision, which shall bring you in an advantageous position.<br /><br />In this video, GM Markus Ragger will show you several aspects related to pawn exchanges:<br /><br />- A pawn exchange as a method of attack.<br />- A pawn exchange as a method of defense.<br /><br />Which pieces like pawn exchanges?<br />- Bishops like pawn exchanges to get open diagonals.<br />- Rooks like pawn exchanges to get open files.<br />- Knights prefer more closed positions and therefore they don't favour pawn exchanges.<br /><br />General:<br />- The attacker should exchange pawns to open files to enter, but he should only exchange the minimum number of pawns, just exactly what he needs to enter the position.<br />- The defender should exchange as many pawns as possible, because if there are less pawns on the board, there are less pawn weaknesses and consequently less pawn weaknesses mean higher drawing chances.<br /><br />üìò The pgn to this video can be downloaded on our website!<br />‚úèÔ∏è Don't miss to solve the provided exercises for this video on our website!<br /><br />‚Äî <br />‚≠êÔ∏è Social Media Links: <br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/chessfactor">https://twitter.com/chessfactor</a> <br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Chessfactorofficial/">https://www.facebook.com/Chessfactorofficial/</a> <br />Lichess: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://lichess.org/@/chessfactor">https://lichess.org/@/chessfactor</a> <br />Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/chessfactor">https://www.twitch.tv/chessfactor</a><br /><br /> ‚Äî <br />‚ôõ Chess Set Links:<br />‚û°Ô∏è Green chess set: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bestchesssetever.com/collections/chess-sets/products/triple-weighted-pieces-green-board">https://www.bestchesssetever.com/collections/chess-sets/products/triple-weighted-pieces-green-board</a> <br />‚û°Ô∏è Wooden chess set: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.chessware.de/Schachfiguren-Turnier-International-Holz-KH-95-mm">https://www.chessware.de/Schachfiguren-Turnier-International-Holz-KH-95-mm</a> <br /><br />‚Äî <br />#Chess #Chessfactor #ChessfactorIntermediate #ChessStrategy{% endraw %}
