They often cause sleep deprivation—especially if regularly you do rotational shifts. <br /><br />Maintaining a normal circadian rhythm is important for your health. <br /><br />Let’s talk about all of the potential problems of working night shifts. <br /><br />1. Increases the risk of depression, dementia, gastrointestinal inflammation, headaches, and sexual dysfunction. <br /><br />2. Increases the risk of metabolic syndrome and heart disease.<br /><br />3. Categorized as a carcinogen. Melatonin suppresses tumors. <br /><br />4. Increases the risk of breast cancer in women by 48%.<br /><br />5. Increases risk of heart-related death.<br /><br />6. 25% more likely to die from lung cancer. <br /><br />7. Women who do night shift work for over five years have a shorter lifespan, and those who do night shift work for over 15 years have a 38% higher risk of heart disease.<br /><br />8. 36% increased risk of diabetes when doing night shifts 8X/month <br /><br />9. Increases risk of obesity and being overweight by 28%. <br /><br />If at all possible, you want to do consistent night shifts as opposed to rotational night shifts. It is very important that you maintain the same sleep schedule throughout the week—even on your days off. <br /> <br />If you are doing night shifts, it’s essential that you stick to a healthy eating plan. Healthy Keto and intermittent fasting can help keep your body healthy. You also want to keep your stress levels very low. <br /><br />If you’re new to keto and IF, check out the other videos on my channel to learn more.<br /><br />Dr. Eric Berg DC Bio:<br />Dr. Berg, age 56, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis &amp; Intermittent Fasting.
