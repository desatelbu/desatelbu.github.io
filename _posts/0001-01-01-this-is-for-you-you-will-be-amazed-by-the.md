{% raw %}THIS IS FOR YOU! You Will be Amazed by the Timing - Louise Hay<br /><br />#LouiseHay #Manifestation #Lawofattraction<br /><br />The way we think and feel certain things, makes us become a certain way, we could be grumpy, whiney or just a plain up person who wants the things in his life to change. Well it starts with a thought, as long as you keep thinking of all the bad in the world, your subconscious mind will make it the fact of reality in your mind, and you will see the world in a way which makes you adapt to being something that you might not want to be, but the matter of a fact is, we only think what we want to think, we alone have complete and total control of what we think about, so its simple really, all we have to do is also think about the good; and that just might be a step forward.<br />Well I hope you guys enjoyed the video, and do make sure to share your thoughts with us in the comment section.<br /><br />üîà SPEAKER :  Louise Hay<br /><br />*CREDIT<br />You can find more of Louise Hay's work here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.louisehay.com">https://www.louisehay.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/louiselhay">https://www.facebook.com/louiselhay</a><br /><br />üõéÔ∏è For more inspiring and motivation videos please subscribe to our channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/c/JustMotivation">https://youtube.com/c/JustMotivation</a><br />And press the bell icon to get a notification, when the new video will be published.<br /><br />üëâFan of Louise Hay?
