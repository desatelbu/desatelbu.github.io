{% raw %}Labour leader, Keir Starmer, yesterday said that Labour's brexit slogan would be &quot;Make Brexit Work.&quot; This has been taken by some to be an attempt to be a  soft brexit party. In reality, it is the first step towards re-joining the EU. Labour cannot promise to take us back into the EU, because it is not possible in the next parliament. But they have stated that they will seek closer alignment with the EU, which is the first step and is achievable.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/adifferentbias">https://www.patreon.com/adifferentbias</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Philmoorhouse76">https://twitter.com/Philmoorhouse76</a>{% endraw %}
