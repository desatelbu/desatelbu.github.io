{% raw %}Episode 8 features Hin Shen (Armenian:  Հին Շեն), which translates as Old Village. Hin Shen is a rural community in the Shushi region of the Artsakh Republic. It is located in the southwestern part of the republic. It is 41 km away from the regional center of Shushi, and 55 km away from the capital Stepanakert. The population of the Hin Shen is 190 people, there are 45 households. <br /><br />During the recent war, this village was in a blockade for 4 days. The Azerbaijani forces tried to put pressure on the Armenian side by setting up outposts on the roads leading to Hin Shen village. But as a result of the intervention of the Russian peacekeeping troops, the Azerbaijani outpost was removed and the village was no longer in a blockade. The villagers themselves showed incredible bravery in pushing back the Azeri troops. One of them tells an incredible story in this episode about confronting Azeri soldiers when the latter tried to ambush the village. <br />______<br />Watch All Previous Episodes Here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVW2jH2wxhw&amp;list=PLWvAzO2gNW-u40PE2Ss7r7ISU-H46H-yx&amp;ab_channel=MariamAvetisyan">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVW2jH2wxhw&amp;list=PLWvAzO2gNW-u40PE2Ss7r7ISU-H46H-yx&amp;ab_channel=MariamAvetisyan</a><br />______<br /><br />My name is Mariam, and I am a filmmaker from Artsakh. I and my colleague Tigran started making a no-commentary-style documentary series to show post-war life in Artsakh called #TheDesireToLive. This short series is aiming to show the effects of the war on the regular people of Artsakh and their livelihood.
