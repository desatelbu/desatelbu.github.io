KPN has been using CA Spectrum® and CA eHeath® for more than 10 years and was one of the earliest adopters of CA Service Operations Insight. KPN is now adding CA Unified Infrastructure Management managed devices and CA Application Performance Management monitored applications into its CA Service Operations Insight models for a more comprehensive view of the business services that IT operations manages. In the process of building its service models, KPN has leveraged Service Discovery policy to automatically generate them, and will share how this has improved efficiency as well as the time it takes to identify what to include in the service models.{% endraw %}
