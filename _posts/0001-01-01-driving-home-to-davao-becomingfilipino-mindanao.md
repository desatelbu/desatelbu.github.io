{% raw %}DRIVING HOME TO DAVAO... <br /><br />It was a #BecomingFilipino car and scooter road trip with Madman and Jandee!  We started in Cagayan de Oro, stopped at a old Philippines jail that is now a restaurant in Malaybalay City, carried on through Bukidnon, and ended up at Kojo Hotel in Tagum.  Always a wonderful feeling to be heading back to Davao.  Mindanao truly is my home here in the Philippines, and every time I road trip across it...<br /><br />Positive and beautiful vibes!<br /><br />Driving home to Davao from Cagayan de Oro!  Home in the Philippines.<br /><br />Power On!<br /><br />*** NEW #BecomingFilipino Drone Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2H-TxqnKbM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2H-TxqnKbM</a><br /><br />*** FOR HAMMOCKS AND SHIRTS JUST MESSAGE VIAJERO OUTDOOR CENTER ON FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://web.facebook.com/viajerocdo/">https://web.facebook.com/viajerocdo/</a><br /><br />*** FOR MORE STORIES AND ADVENTURES CHECK OUT MY FACEBOOK PAGE: #BecomingFilipino{% endraw %}
