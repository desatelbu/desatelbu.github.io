{% raw %}Charles Smith spoke with a couple of his Imply colleagues who are Druid whizzes: Rachel Pedreschi, the VP of Community and Jon King, Principal Field Architect. We talked about the types of challenges facing most Druid Proof of Concept (POC) projects. Rachel and Jon broke down the most common issues you might have getting off the ground with Druid into the following categories: Cluster sizing, Data architecture, Log access and troubleshooting,  Querying, and “Sessionized” data. Watch the talk for all the tips that Jon and Rachel offer to help you develop your Druid ESP!{% endraw %}
