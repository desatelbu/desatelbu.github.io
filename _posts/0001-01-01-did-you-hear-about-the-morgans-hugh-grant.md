{% raw %}Hugh Grant and Sara Jessica Parker star in this delightful comedy about finding love in the most unexpected places. Two successful New Yorkers, Paul (Grant) and Meryl (Parker), are at their wits' end with repairing their strained marriage. But when they become the only witnesses to a brutal murder, the police hide them away in Wyoming -- together. Now these die-hard city dwellers will have to survive the weather, bears, fresh air, and forced time with one another if they want to make it out alive.
