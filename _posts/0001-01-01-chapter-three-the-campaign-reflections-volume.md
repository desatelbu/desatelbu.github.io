{% raw %}Campaign fishing requires an incredible amount of dedication; how ever long it takes, you have an end goal and the only way you can achieve your goal is maximum effort. Adam Penning is well versed in this aspect of the sport, and loves nothing more than targeting one lake, often, with one specific fish on his mind.<br /><br />For the last 18 months, Adam has set his sights on Hope Lake, part of the Grendon complex in Northamptonshire, where we join him for a look back on an incredibly prolific period of angling. With his eyes set firmly on a huge common known as Tyson, which could weigh in excess of 60lb, Adam relays the challenges he faced as well as some seriously impressive carp he caught along the way. In Adamâ€™s opinion, the fish he caught from Grendon are amongst the best he has ever caught, which is some statement and the exact reason why this is a must watch.  <br /><br />#StickyBaits #CarpFishing #Reflections #Fishing<br /><br />Sticky Baits LTD<br />www.stickybaits.com<br />Musicbed SyncID:<br />MB01KBTYGJ3QRCE{% endraw %}
