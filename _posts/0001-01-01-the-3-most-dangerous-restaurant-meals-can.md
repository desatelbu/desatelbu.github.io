It‚Äôs important to keep in mind that combining sugar (or this much refined carb) with protein or fat and heating it will cause glycation. This will clog your arteries and can cause many different health issues. <br /><br />I believe the types of meals like those on this list are why a lot of children are developing a fatty liver, why much of the population is headed towards diabetes, and why the great majority of the population has many different health issues. <br /><br />3 most dangerous restaurant meals:<br />1. Pancakes, hashbrowns, orange juice, and sausage <br />Pancakes contain:<br /> ‚Ä¢ Wheat flour<br /> ‚Ä¢ Gluten<br /> ‚Ä¢ Modified food starch<br /> ‚Ä¢ Soy flour <br /> ‚Ä¢ Hydrogenated soy (trans fats) <br /> ‚Ä¢ Fortified iron (will cause bloating) <br /><br />Hashbrowns contain:<br /> ‚Ä¢ Corn starch <br /> ‚Ä¢ Dextrose <br /> ‚Ä¢ Maltodextrin <br /> ‚Ä¢ Potato <br /> ‚Ä¢ Vegetable oil<br /><br />Orange juice contains:<br /> ‚Ä¢ No vitamins <br /><br />Sausage contains:<br /> ‚Ä¢ Sugar<br /> ‚Ä¢ MSG<br /><br />2.
