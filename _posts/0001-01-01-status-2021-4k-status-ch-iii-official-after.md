{% raw %}Status Ch. III Official After Movie.<br />The third instalment of the Melbourne based show has never been bigger than this. Feast on the week long efforts put into this video by interstate travellers, attendees and drivers. Everyone came in their best to show the rest with various custom skate deck trophies being awarded to those who deserved it. <br /><br />The brains and crew behind the show deserve every bit of love and appreciation as this was one show that we will never forget. Thank you to all who traveled far and wide to attend and bring their rides to this years event. It hasn't been an easy road for everybody and there were very uncertain times for the event industry. From the bottom of our hearts of everybody involved we would like to thank you for your support!<br /><br />Enjoy this alternative vision of how I spent 7 days in Melbourne for the third year of the Status reign.<br /><br />@Status.Seasonal<br />- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.statusseasonal.com.au">https://www.statusseasonal.com.au</a><br /><br />@d_a_t_e_d<br />Store opening early 2022<br />- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.datedmedia.com">https://www.datedmedia.com</a><br /><br />PATREON <br />Want to be the reason this channel grows?
