{% raw %}Prince Harry is back in New York tomorrow presenting 5 people with the Intrepid Valour Awards on behalf of the Salute to Freedom Gala with his Invictus Buddy Jon Bon Jovi!! Held on a World War 2 warship. Harry is not allowed to wear his military uniform but he is allowed to wear his medals which I am sure he is at home polishing them up right now ready for his private Jet to collect him nice and early!!<br /><br />So where we can not seem to get away with Meghan or Harry promoting, posturing, preaching something to the masses, normally about kindness and compassion, it has come as quite the shock that he has remained silent on The Crown's portrayal of his Mother. The fact Jemima Khan has walked away from helping the creators makes me think they are not going to paint Diana in a very flattering light. They need to keep those ratings up and I guess Harry wants to keep the contract. How sad for even a UK Prince, born extremely wealthy that money can still choose for him.{% endraw %}
