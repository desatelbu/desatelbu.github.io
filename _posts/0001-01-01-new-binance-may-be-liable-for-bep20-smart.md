The original video I did on the issue with BEP20 to Coinbase or other exchanges, can be found here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/bEUTHbnxHpU">https://youtu.be/bEUTHbnxHpU</a><br /><br />I have helped countless people recover funds where they incorrectly sent BEP20 tokens to Coinbase’s WALLET app, which is different from the exchange. Everyone else has been patiently waiting for Coinbase and other exchanges to support the Binance Smart Chain network, at which point all the funds in limbo should become accessible.<br /><br />I believe I have discovered a potential plan whereby Binance is intentionally causing their customers to improperly use BSC, causing two issues to benefit themselves.<br /><br />1. Customers of custodial exchanges like Coinbase are livid and will cancel their accounts to move their trading to international Binance, or Binance.us for Americans.<br />2. It also causes tens of thousands of customers to complain and DEMAND these exchanges accept and support Binance Smart Chain.<br /><br />I’m anxiously await more attorneys to contact me, as we have the data and the pre-built class ready to go, if we can indeed demonstrate Binance’s liability here!
