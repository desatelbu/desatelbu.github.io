{% raw %}Two extremes tend to exist when it comes to corporate worship. There are those who elevate emotions/experience during worship and then are those who devalue experience/emotions in worship. Both extremes have some truth in them. <br /><br />One recognizes that God created us with emotions that are meant to be engaged, rather than suppressed. To welcome emotions in worship is to allow people to worship with their tears, their joy, and their lament. The other emphasizes that a right understanding of God should lead to the right worship of God. So when our God-given mind is fed truth, the heart is sure to follow. <br /><br />Just Worship Entertainment was created to be where both extremes can find balance. Where people can worship God with their heart and their mind, freely and faithfully. <br /><br />---<br /><br />Just Worship Album coming soon! <br />www.withtheperrys.com{% endraw %}
