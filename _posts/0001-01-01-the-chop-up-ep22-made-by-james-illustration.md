{% raw %}In this episode of The Chop Up, Dan and Dustin welcome Made By James to the show. <br /><br />James Martin (aka Made By James) is a logo designer based out of the UK and one of the more popular logo designers on Instagram. We've been fans of him for quite a while so it was an honor to be contacted by him to kick in some designs for his brand.<br /><br />We also talk about his new book which is coming out in November! Pre order his book from his website:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.madebyjames.co/made-by-james-book">https://www.madebyjames.co/made-by-james-book</a><br /><br />Finally, Dan and Dustin talk about the launch of our very own next book in the Mayhem series of design books, Illustration Mayhem.
