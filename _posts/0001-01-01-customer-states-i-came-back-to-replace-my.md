{% raw %}Hey guys, well they came back. I guess the customer didn't like the truck shaking apart at 25 mph. We go through the old school way of replacing the center U-joint in this Toyota Tundra. It's been a while since I have replaced a u-joint, are there any new tools out there that make it easier? Lmk in the comments. Enjoy!{% endraw %}
