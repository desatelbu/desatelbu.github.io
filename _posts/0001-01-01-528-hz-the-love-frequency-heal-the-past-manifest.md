In recent times, each frequency has been found to carry a specific set of healing, wellbeing and spiritual benefits that it affords the listener.<br /><br />These include DNA repair, relief from past traumas and opening the soul to spiritual experiences.<br /><br />We tune all of our music in the miracle tone, 528 Hz. <br /><br />528 Hz (Mi) â€“ Transforming Miracles (DNA Repair)<br /><br />528 HZ, also known as the miracle tone, is the frequency that is thought to help return human DNA to its original state, removing impurities.<br />By repairing your DNA, youâ€™re not only enhancing your life energy, but your mindset improves. You can expect to attain greater mental clarity, a heightened sense of awareness, and deep inner peace.<br /><br />Related to the chakra of the solar plexus, opening this chakra allows you to feel confident in yourself, greater self-worth and love, and be in control of your life.<br /><br />ðŸŒ¸ Learn more about the healing Solfeggio frequenciesðŸŒ¸ <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://selfhealingcollective.com/hea...">https://selfhealingcollective.com/hea...</a><br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />DOWNLOAD MUSIC: <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://selfhealingcollective.com/aud...">https://selfhealingcollective.com/aud...</a><br /><br />RETURN TO ONENESS CLOTHING STORE: <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://selfhealingcollective.com/shop/">https://selfhealingcollective.com/shop/</a><br /><br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Read More: <br /><br />INFO ON PRAYER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://selfhealingcollective.com/pra...">https://selfhealingcollective.com/pra...</a><br /><br />INFO ON MEDITATION: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://selfhealingcollective.com/med...">https://selfhealingcollective.com/med...</a><br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />WHO ARE WE?<br /><br />We at Self- Healing Collective have a deep passion for music, spirituality, prayer, mindfulness, nature, healing, and creativity.
