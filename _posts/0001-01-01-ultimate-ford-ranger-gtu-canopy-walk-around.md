{% raw %}This Ford Ranger build is a Swiss Army knife of builds! It has everything... even the kitchen sink! Jimmy takes us for a walk through of this ultimate Ford Ranger Canopy build. <br /><br />At the heart of the GTU Model is the revolutionary Core Offroad kitchen design.  Plenty of storage and lighting, two work benches, a removable sink, rebated sink tap with hot and cold water. All of this on a gas strut assisted soft open and close system.<br /><br />A 110L upright fridge coupled with a 30L drawer fridge on the other side ensures there is plenty of storage for those long trips away.  A 23 Zero 270 awning, 100L water tank, built in compressor, 120 ah Enerdrive Lithium Battery, Fusion stereo, central locking, internal STEDI RGB lighting and rear work lights and a Joolca hot water system. All of these features come standard with the GTU model.<br /><br />On top of all this we have added an IKamper 4X roof top tent with 2x100watt solar panels and a rear mounted 23 Zero shower tent.<br /><br />There is so much more to this setup and an absolute dream come true for our customer!
