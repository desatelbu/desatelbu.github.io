{% raw %}Texas’ Best Whitetail Genetics?!<br /><br />On this special online only episode, we visit Limitless Genetics in south central Texas. This deer breeding operation is owned by Jesse and Mia Boger who happen to be some of the youngest deer farmers in the deer industry. But don’t let their age fool you because the deer at this operation will rival operations that have been breeding deer for over three decades. The breeding strategies that have been created are extremely successful consistently producing monster deer year after year. The legendary breeder buck Brain Freeze put Jesse and Mia on the map in the deer breeding industry and it helped them create mind blowing bucks like Big Slick, Inception and Total Package. <br /><br />Big dreams do come true when hard work, dedication and a solid work ethic are focused on week after week, year after year. The choices used when breeding truly are Limitless. That’s why they are known as Limitless Genetics.  <br /><br />For more information on Limitless Genetics visit www.limitlessgenetics.com<br /><br />WATCH ALL EPISODES FREE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.deerandwildlifestories.com/full-episodes">https://www.deerandwildlifestories.com/full-episodes</a><br /><br />Deer and Wildlife Stories is brough to you by: <br />Davine Genetics: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3n1gMPp">https://bit.ly/3n1gMPp</a><br />LE Fence Company: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3dphxhU">https://bit.ly/3dphxhU</a><br />Malouf Whitetails: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3dpT10o">https://bit.ly/3dpT10o</a><br />MVP Whitetails: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3adRb0s">https://bit.ly/3adRb0s</a><br />The North American Deer Registry: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3ggFw51">https://bit.ly/3ggFw51</a><br />Pneu Dart: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2M8H0Ok">https://bit.ly/2M8H0Ok</a><br />Record Rack: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2ZrNlcL">http://bit.ly/2ZrNlcL</a><br />UVC Powersports Tractors and Outdoors: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/31909VO">http://bit.ly/31909VO</a><br />Vandergriff Toyota: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3uZoNHA">https://bit.ly/3uZoNHA</a><br />Whitetails of Louisiana: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3eaZOKm">https://bit.ly/3eaZOKm</a><br /><br />Deer &amp; Wildlife Stories with Keith Warren is the voice of the deer industry (TM) airing 5 times on the Pursuit Channel (DirecTV 604 and Dish 393) as well as online in 2020.

Then, contact your state deer farm association and ask to see if they provide any kind of tutoring or educational opportunities. Also, attend deer farming conventions and meet local deer farmers. Finally, I’d suggest visiting as many farms as possible.<br /><br />What's the best advice Keith has for new Deer Farmers?<br />Visit as many deer farms as possible and develop a business plan.<br /><br />What is the North American Deer Registry?<br />The North American Deer Registry is what I like to refer to as “the holy grail of deer farming”. It has literally hundreds of thousands of animals listed that will provide the breeder with valuable information to assist in breeding, purchasing and selling deer.<br /><br />How much property do I need to start a deer farm?<br />Normally the smallest deer pen I like to see if a half acre. Most are an acre in size. So you don’t need a lot of land to build deer pens. Make sure and take into consideration neighbors as deer tend to be high strung and the fewer close by neighbors the better. It’s also advisable to have shade available as well as lots of fresh water that is provided in water throughs.<br /><br />How do I breed for consistency?<br />Breeding for consistency is done by choosing proven sires and dams that throw offspring you are seeking to produce.<br /><br />What is Artificial Insemination and what is the success rate?<br />Artificial Insemination or what we call in the industry “AI” is a method used to impregnate deer with specific semen so that parentage and offspring can be predetermined.<br /><br />Why partner on a deer?<br />There are many reasons to partner of deer but the biggest reason is to lessen the cost to obtain ownership, albeit partial ownership. Partnerships are becoming more commonplace in the deer industry.<br /><br />What is the best deer feed and feeding schedule?<br />I’ve fed Record Rack deer feed for over twenty years and have done so because the science that goes into it. Literally, the scientists at Record Rack continue to push the envelope with research and the results are incredible. Most successful deer breeders feed their deer free choice out of some kind of trough feeder so that they are able to monitor consumption on a daily basis. This allows them to be able to determine if there may be health issues with their herd as reduced consumption may indicate some kind of problem.<br /><br />What are the national deer organizations to join and why?<br />NADeFA is the North American Deer Farmers Association and their purpose is to represent the deer industry and its members on a national level.<br /><br />The DBC (Deer Breeders Corporation) also works to represent deer breeders noaas well as support scientific research on whitetail deer.{% endraw %}
