{% raw %}Understanding consumers’ associations with brands is a central part of brand management. However, this is challenging because consumers can associate a brand with any number of objects, emotions, activities, sceneries, and concepts. This research presents an elicitation platform, methodology, and results from a sample of over 300 U.S. national brands. The proposed platform, Brand Visual Elicitation Platform (B-VEP), allows firms to collect online brand collages from consumers. Using unsupervised machine-learning and image-processing approaches, the authors analyze the collages to obtain a detailed set of associations for each brand. The elicitation is direct, unaided, scalable, quantitative, and uses the power of visuals to depict a detailed representation of respondents’ relationships with a brand. The value of the tool is discussed, including: obtaining prototypical brand visuals; relating associations to brand personality and equity; identifying favorable associations per category; exploring brand uniqueness through differentiating associations; and identifying commonalities between brands across categories for potential collaborations.<br /><br />Journal of Marketing Webinar: January 27, 2021<br /><br />Featured Speakers: Daria Dzyabura (New Economic School and NYU Stern School of Business) and Renana Peres (Hebrew University)<br /><br />Read more about this study: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ama.org/2021/01/27/an-innovative-new-way-to-measure-consumers-brand-perceptions/">https://www.ama.org/2021/01/27/an-innovative-new-way-to-measure-consumers-brand-perceptions/</a>{% endraw %}
