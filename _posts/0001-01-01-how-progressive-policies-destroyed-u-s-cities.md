{% raw %}Dave Rubin of The Rubin Report talks to Michael Shellenberger about his new book “San Fransicko”, why he left the Democratic Party, how progressive cities made things much worse for the most vulnerable, the real reason that progressives defend petty theft, and why the modern day left has turned its back on the once embraced Viktor Frankl. First, Michael shares why he left the left and is no longer a Democrat. He describes how in the course of writing about the failures of progressive policies he realized he didn’t feel comfortable with the Democratic label any more. Next, Michael talks about how the policies of liberal cities like San Francisco, Seattle, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and Portland have actually made the problems they tried to fix much worse. The growth of homeless encampments, open air drug markets, mental illness and drug addiction have all been enabled by the policies meant to address them. The homeless crisis has only grown in size in these cities in areas like Venice Beach, the Kensington neighborhood in Philadelphia, skid row, the Blade and the Tenderloin. Michael explains how California’s housing first policy has backfired no matter how much money the state directs toward supportive housing and mental illness. Michael also describes how policies like decriminalizing shoplifting simply incentivize misdemeanor theft. He explains how the true roots of this effort to justify theft come from socialist and anarchists in the past who simply hated capitalism. Michael also shares how his appearance on conservative programs has threatened his relationships with progressive friends. Finally, Michael discusses the dangers of embracing a victimhood mentality. He explains how concentration camp survivor and author of “Man’s Search for Meaning” Viktor Frankl was embraced by liberals. Now his message of taking responsibility for your life and facing adversity has been replaced by the pushing of a victim mindset.<br /><br />Watch Dave Rubin’s PREVIOUS INTERVIEW with MICHAEL SHELLENBERGER here: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-7DIv3AU1o&amp;list=PLEbhOtC9klbCr0iN2ANJbaV477B0eSpc6&amp;index=4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-7DIv3AU1o&amp;list=PLEbhOtC9klbCr0iN2ANJbaV477B0eSpc6&amp;index=4</a><br /><br />Is the state of US news driving you crazy?
