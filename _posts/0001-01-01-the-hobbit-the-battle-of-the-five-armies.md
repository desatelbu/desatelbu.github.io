Tolkien's enduring masterpiece. Set in Middle-earth 60 years before the epic Lord of the Rings trilogy, the adventure follows the journey of Bilbo Baggins, who is swept into an epic quest to reclaim the lost Dwarf Kingdom from the fearsome dragon Smaug. Approached out of the blue by the wizard Gandalf, Bilbo finds himself joining a company of dwarves on a journey into wild, treacherous lands swarming with beasts of every ilk. After reaching Erebor and encountering the dragon Smaug, Five Armies assemble for an epic battle that could decide the future of all in Middle-earth.<br /><br />Connect with WaterTower Music:<br />Follow WaterTower Music on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/watertowermusic">https://www.instagram.com/watertowermusic</a><br />Like WaterTower Music on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/WaterTowerMusic">https://www.facebook.com/WaterTowerMusic</a><br />Follow WaterTower Music on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/watertowermusic">https://twitter.com/watertowermusic</a><br />Visit WaterTower Music at: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.watertower-music.com/">https://www.watertower-music.com/</a><br /><br />About WaterTower Music:<br />WaterTower Music, the in-house label for the WarnerMedia companies, releases recorded music as rich and diverse as the companies themselves.
