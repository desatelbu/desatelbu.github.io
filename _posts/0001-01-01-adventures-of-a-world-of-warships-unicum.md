{% raw %}Ah.  The tier 5 Omaha.  Weak armor.  Pea shooters for guns.  And some reason I play really well in it in World of Warships.  Especially when bottomed tiered.  It's not that bad of a ship though.  It's nimble, quick and has lot's of guns that have great firing angles.  It also has short ranged torps.  But... at bottom tier its armor is paper thin and it like to go pop.  <br /><br />- Other places to find me -<br /><br />Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitch.tv/nozoupforyou">http://www.twitch.tv/nozoupforyou</a><br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/nozoupforyou">https://www.facebook.com/nozoupforyou</a><br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/NoZoupForYou_">https://twitter.com/NoZoupForYou_</a><br /><br /><br /><br />If you like this video don't forget to LIKE and SUBSCRIBE for more videos <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ZoupGaming">https://www.youtube.com/user/ZoupGaming</a>{% endraw %}
