{% raw %}The IT industry develops highly innovative products. Running and servicing them has become increasingly complex for companies to manage in-house, with IT departments finding themselves under pressure as they try to keep up with the latest developments. This is especially true for end user devices such as PCs, notebooks, tablets, and printers. These must be ready for use â€“ worldwide and around the clock.<br />Furthermore, expectations for IT devices have changed considerably. Users want a fully configured system where both the hardware and software are fully up to speed. They also want to have safe access to their applications and data. How can IT service providers meet all these demands?<br />Device as a Service (DaaS) is the answer.
