{% raw %}Mr. Srinivas Venkatram (Founder-Lead, Illumine) shares examples from his work to demonstrate how it is possible to apply and work out the ideas and frameworks of Swami Vivekananda and the impact it can have.<br /><br />In this talk, he specifically takes Swami Vivekananda's Vedantic axiom  - &quot;Every person has infinite potential within&quot; - as a foundation and explores how we can rebuild education, institutions and communities from the point of view of 'awakening potential'.<br /><br />This talk was part of an event hosted by Ramakrishna Vedanta Centre, UK on the theme: &quot;Shaping the future of humanity: what we can learn from Swami Vivekananda&quot;.  <br /><br />The event was held on 02, December 2018 at the Mahatma Gandhi Hall, YMCA Indian Student Hostel, UK.{% endraw %}
