{% raw %}Today we bring back gaming videos to the channel, playing Gas Station Simulator, a surprisingly relaxing and satisfying game!<br />I did film a part 2 to this immediately after, but my elgato didn't capture the video properly so it's sadly lost - let me know if you would like to see a part 2!<br /><br />Go check out @JubileeWhispers it was her video which inspired this one!<br />--<br />If you enjoyed this video, consider subscribing! You can expect a new ASMR video every Monday and Thursday!<br /><br />Take a look at some of my playlists: <br />ASMR History Videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkiq8AQVugskHTLF5UvXGgZmCzablLLBX">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkiq8AQVugskHTLF5UvXGgZmCzablLLBX</a><br />ASMR Conspiracy Theories: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkiq8AQVugsksyoUVT5PG_81jZpmyXL60">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkiq8AQVugsksyoUVT5PG_81jZpmyXL60</a><br />ASMR Fact Videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkiq8AQVugsmGsahEuvmuQcCH2aVAS-2K">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkiq8AQVugsmGsahEuvmuQcCH2aVAS-2K</a><br />ASMR Rambles: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkiq8AQVugsnlRTvFSlcXiWUywA6i5cUD">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkiq8AQVugsnlRTvFSlcXiWUywA6i5cUD</a>{% endraw %}
