{% raw %}This is a guided hypnosis session for enhancing your memory. This session helps you be more aware and helps you learn many things and you know you can access any of these learnings in the future.<br /> <br />This session induces you into a hypnotic trance easily and effortlessly by relaxing your whole body. All the way from the top of your head to the tips of your toes. The session also uses a 10 count deepener to deepen your relaxation so you may be the most relaxed you have ever felt before.<br />This session teaches you a really useful way to learn and memorize. One of the reasons you have this great memory is because you also have a strong desire to learn and you always follow a simple system that works best for you. What you can do when listening to someone is you can slightly look up so you can also access the visual part of your mind. This helps you learn easily. <br /><br />The next part is a fun visualization technique where you choose your favorite place to learn and there is a pencil and a piece of paper. You can sharpen the pencil and start writing things that you want to memorize from this session. It doesnâ€™t matter how much you write because you will remember it. The session then has many affirmations and suggestions that you can write down using this pencil and piece of paper. <br /><br />You can contemplate these questions: Do you feel good that you have made a decision today to improve your memory performance? Do you feel good you are finding it easy to succeed? Do you feel good that you have these pieces of paper in your mind with your writing so you can calmly and confidently recall everything you need to know? Before you reorient to the room. <br /><br />If there is a particular session you would like to hear please let us know in the comments. <br /><br />To Purchase our book on Kindle: How To Let Go Of Negative Emotions please go to: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Z7fUN9">https://amzn.to/2Z7fUN9</a> <br /><br />To join our Meditation and Self-Hypnosis Group go to: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2qwQcF5">http://bit.ly/2qwQcF5</a> <br /><br />We have daily posts sharing techniques and videos for self-hypnosis and strategies that work to achieve relaxation. <br /><br />For our guided hypnosis sessions please go to: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2Bk0oSu">https://bit.ly/2Bk0oSu</a> <br /><br />Our Facebook page: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/athensnlp.gr/">https://www.facebook.com/athensnlp.gr/</a> <br /><br />Our Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://athensnlp.gr/">https://athensnlp.gr/</a> <br /><br />We hope you enjoy this session and please give it a like and share with your family and friends.
