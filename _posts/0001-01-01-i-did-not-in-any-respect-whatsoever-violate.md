{% raw %}Since local media organisations commenced publication of the leaked #PandoraPapers, former Governor Peter Obi has been hard-pressed to deny the revelations on his secret business dealings overseas.<br /><br />Like similar document leaks before it, the Pandora Papers have helped to expose the concealed fortunes in offshore tax havens and, in some cases, money laundering by some of the most powerful people in the world.<br /><br />But in a statement, Obi dismissed a report by Premium Times, which disclosed that the former governor had concealed a number of offshore businesses and investments when he was at the helm of affairs in #Anambra State.<br /><br />According to #MusikiluMojeed, Editor-in-Chief of Premium Times, Obi may have violated the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act by not declaring his or that of his familyâ€™s beneficial ownership in the said assets.<br /><br />Mojeed, who was on the show last week, added that the former governor flouted the Nigerian Constitution by operating a foreign bank account while in office and may have concealed his offshore investments to avoid tax.<br /><br />Well, in our time-honored tradition of giving all sides a right of reply,  #PeterObi, former #AnambraState governor, gives us his side of the story on the allegations made against him by #PremiumTimes.<br /><br />#TheMorningShow  #ReubenAbati #TundunAbiola  #RufaiOseni <br />#nigeria #nigerians #dailynews #news #globalnews<br />#NIGERIANNEWS #TRENDING #trendingvideo #politics <br /><br />Subscribe to our Channel for high profile interviews.
