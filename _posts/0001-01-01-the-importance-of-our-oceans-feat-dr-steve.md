{% raw %}Had the honour of interviewing professor and marine biologist Dr. Steve Simpson, discussing the importance of our oceans and how life on Earth relies on our seas. Dr. Simpson, who makes an appearance in Blue Planet II, was a professor of mine during my undergraduate years at the University of Exeter and has been a huge inspiration to me; his research, vision and goals.<br /><br />Becoming a wildlife filmmaker is a personal aspiration. This video combines footage taken in Bahamas and Valencia.{% endraw %}
