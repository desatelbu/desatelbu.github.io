{% raw %}This is the Most Safest House in the entire Minecraft. And in this Video we will build it!

This Safe Base is what Dream could need in the Minecraft Manhunt! Sapnap and Georgenotfound would definitely loose the Manhunt if Dream uses this Safe Base Base! I love to build these Ideas with my friends or prank my friends on a Minecraft Server. The Hermitcraft Server with Grian and Mumbo Jumbo could use the Safest House for their Pranks too. It is always funny and we laugh a lot! Minecraft: 10+ Simple Redstone Builds! This Video is the same style like the Minecraft: 10+ Zombie Redstone Build Hacks and also the Among Us and Fortnite video I am planning to upload!<br /><br />ðŸ‘‡ Join My Discord-Server here! ðŸ‘‡<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.com/invite/ZX25NtZ">https://discord.com/invite/ZX25NtZ</a><br /><br />Stay Safe Minecrafters!
