{% raw %}Hi Everyone!<br /><br />We are back after a 2 week break! Last Sunday, Megan celebrated her 30th birthday so we had a very chilled day at home with family.<br /><br />Life with a newborn is tough. Rupert is going through a growth spurt at the moment and hasn’t been very happy lately. <br /><br />So, we travelled to Norfolk to spend some time with Jamie’s parents and get additional support. <br /><br />Amongst the endless feeding, winding and changing, we found time to head out and go raspberry picking, have a pizza night, go baby shopping and celebrate Megan’s special birthday. <br /><br />If anybody has any newborn winding techniques or tips, do let us know! We think Rupert may have colic :( <br /><br />We are determined to do some singing this week or anything that isn’t baby related!<br /><br />INSTAGRAM //<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/jamie_and_megan/">https://www.instagram.com/jamie_and_megan/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/megan_cooper_colvin/">https://www.instagram.com/megan_cooper_colvin/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/jamieacolvin/">https://www.instagram.com/jamieacolvin/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/jamieandmegan/">https://www.tiktok.com/jamieandmegan/</a>{% endraw %}
