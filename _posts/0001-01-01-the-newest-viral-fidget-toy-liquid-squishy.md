It was a hilariously random discovery after injecting some squishy phone cases with water. I never realised that mochi squishies can stretch to accommodate bubbles and also maintain that shape for quite a long time. I did something similar with DIY Hitohada Gel squishies a few years ago but didn't think of trying it with silicone ones.  <br />#satisfying​​ #fidget #popit<br /><br />♥ Shopping Links ♥<br />Syringes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3vsb64e">https://amzn.to/3vsb64e</a><br />NOTE: If you are under 18, please get your parent or guardians' permission before ordering needles! It's often easier to find &quot;blunt tipped&quot; needles which aren't designed for medical use. The thinnest type of blunt tipped needles work just fine for this DIY. <br />Squishy Corgi Phone Case (from video): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3vtvyli">https://amzn.to/3vtvyli</a><br />Squishy Pig Phone Case: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3yFXDYC">https://amzn.to/3yFXDYC</a><br />DISCLAIMER: Amazon products are affiliate links which means I receive a very small commission if you buy it through here.
