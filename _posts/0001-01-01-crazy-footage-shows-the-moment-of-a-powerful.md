{% raw %}H.A.A.R.P or not? Please comment below!<br />#storm #tornado #hurricane #australia #sydney<br />A bizarre tornado-like storm ravages Sydney, causing dozens of homes to collapse - eyewitnesses say they heard heart-rending screams as the trees fell to the ground. Strong gusts of wind that came out of nowhere in what fire chiefs call &quot;minicyclones&quot; left a devastating imprint: houses were destroyed and 20,000 people were left without electricity. New South Wales police confirmed on Sunday that strong winds combined with lightning had knocked down a tree in Narrabin, which hit the roof of a car while the three women were inside. Witnesses said they heard the screams of those in the car but could do little to save them when the wreckage fell. A startled resident filmed the moment when a gust of wind blew from the roof of a neighboring building. The &quot;violent&quot; storm caused chaos on the roads: traffic lights were out and transmission towers blocked the streets. Local residents also reported that widespread power outages affected 20,000 homes. &quot;Since 3:30 pm, emergency services have received several reports of hurricane damage in the North Beach area with trees and power lines in the suburbs of Mona Vale to Forestville,&quot; New South Wales police said.{% endraw %}
