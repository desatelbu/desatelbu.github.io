{% raw %}My DiResta Razor Shirt : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rlnk.cc/the-diresta-razor-shirt">https://rlnk.cc/the-diresta-razor-shirt</a> <br />In this project video I document the raising of a barn frame on my property! This traditional post and beam horse barn was designed by Taylor Forrest and Built by Brett Pulliam. The foundation was install last year (August 2020) with intentions of us doing the frame with our maker friends, but with the world being what it is, and a busy year, we decided to hire a professional to cut and erect the frame... and we are very happy we did! <br /><br />Thank you Brett! In the upcoming year we will document the roof and closing in of the barn. It will be used for up to 4 horses and an apartment. thank you ! xo{% endraw %}
