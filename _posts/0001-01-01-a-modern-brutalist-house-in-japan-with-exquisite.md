{% raw %}Architects: Apollo - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://apollo-aa.jp/">https://apollo-aa.jp/</a><br />According to the architects:<br />This ranch-style home is located in a quiet suburban neighborhood in the Kanto region. The clients purchased the tiered, irregularly shaped lot as a place to spend meaningful time as a family. They wanted courtyards to play a big part in their home life, and to fulfill that request, the design makes use of the distinctive property shape and topography.{% endraw %}
