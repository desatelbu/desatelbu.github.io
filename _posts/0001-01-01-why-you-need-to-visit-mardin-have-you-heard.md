{% raw %}Have you heard of Mardin Turkey? This needs to be on your travel bucket list. We are currently on a 2 month road trip around Turkey and almost accidentally discovered Mardin and are so glad that we did! Mardin is a picturesque mountain town near the border of Syria, in the south easter part of Turkey. Between the incredible architecture, the amazing food... and of course the trash donkeys, we really need to consider visiting :) <br /><br />The Airbnb we stayed at: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://abnb.me/VA7K8OiAZkb">https://abnb.me/VA7K8OiAZkb</a><br /><br />The breakfast restaurant: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/maps/XPmHgBkNsiEBfbC77">https://goo.gl/maps/XPmHgBkNsiEBfbC77</a><br /><br />Want to help keep us on the road?

We are Heather, Bradey, Alexa and Chloe. <br />We are raising our kids to face their fears, to step outside of their comfort zones and to try new things. Family travel is the best way we know how to do this.<br />We want to inspire others to travel with an open mind and to see that it is completely possible to travel and fly with kids! Traveling is one of the best things we have ever done to strengthen our family, and to open up our minds about how big this world is. <br />Thanks for following along!<br /><br />#Travel #Turkey #WeSleptHere{% endraw %}
