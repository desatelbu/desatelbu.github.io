{% raw %}In this video I run through some changes to the way that we sing minor melodies.  The theory hasn't changed, but, like many things in music theory, there are a number of different interpretations.  <br /><br />We have decided to align the solfege syllables and hand signs to the parallel minor, or put another way, an alteration of the major scale.  <br /><br />I hope this helps you learn your minor solfege hand signs and syllables.<br /><br />Cheers{% endraw %}
