{% raw %}On the Right Track Documentary captures examples of reckless driving on South Australian beaches that endangers people on the beach, disturbs beach nesting birds and destroys the coastal environment. <br />The documentary will be used to educate the public about how to share the beach with the birds so that iconic species such as the Hooded Plover are not disrupted during their nesting, feeding and roosting. The documentary has received strong support from birding organisation such as Birds SA and BirdLife Australia.<br /><br />Year of Production 2021<br />Director, Editor, Cinematography Davide Gaglio framethesouth.com<br />Music by Riccardo Ponzo <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ILMUSIKO">https://www.youtube.com/user/ILMUSIKO</a><br />Hang performed by Roberto Garcia{% endraw %}
