{% raw %}TRUST COMPLETELY | The Word Exposed with Cardinal Tagle (November 7, 2021)<br />Subscribe to JesComTV <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3p14VDY">https://bit.ly/3p14VDY</a><br />#TheWordExposed #CardinalTagle #32ndSundayinOrdinaryTime<br /><br />We are on the Thirty-second Sunday in Ordinary Time; in the Gospel, Jesus observed the crowd as they “put money into the treasury.” <br />He tells his disciples that the poor widow, who “put in two small coins worth a few cents,” contributed more than all the others—because she gave “all she had, her whole livelihood.”<br />Why would the poor widow do that? It’s because of her trust in God. Friends, may our generosity become a manifestation of our trust in the providence of God, as we see also in the Widow at Zarephath in the first reading and in Jesus himself.<br />______________ <br />The Word Exposed with Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle, Prefect of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples reflects on Sunday's Mass readings each week. From the Vatican, produced by Jesuit Communications. <br /><br />Please support our Mission.
