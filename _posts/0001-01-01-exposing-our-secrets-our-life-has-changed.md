{% raw %}Our life has changed SO much since we gave up vanlife to park off grid in the woods and while it's been wild and wonderful, there are definitely parts we haven't discussed with you! We’ve been fighting the cold for the last week or so and with missing parts for the geodesic dome, sauna, and bad weather…we’re taking it as a sign to rest this week but wanted to sit down and do a Q&amp;A to expose all our juicy secrets we don't get to chat about in our regular vlogs! #vanlife #buildtimelapse #qanda<br /><br />For an EXTENDED version of this video, join us on Patreon! <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/tylerandtodd">https://www.patreon.com/tylerandtodd</a> <br /><br />If you enjoyed our videos, make sure you tell a friend, co-worker, or family member about this lifestyle…it makes a huge difference for our channel &amp; community! <br />The vlog continues on Instagram: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/tylerandtodd">https://www.instagram.com/tylerandtodd</a><br /><br />How did we get here? <br />After a year of full time travel living the vanlife, we had to adapt when the world changed. To keep busy we’ve converted our tiny house on wheels into a fully functioning off grid tiny house that has everything we need. Realizing that none of us know how long this new normal will stick around, we made the decision that building a home here was the best decision we could make. We've spent the last year doing EVERYTHING involved with coordinating and planning the build ourselves as well as setting up this off grid property to be able to provide us with the the food we'll need in the future. Hit with constant delays and building price increases, realizing our dream of building our own home has taken longer than anticipated. With travel starting to reopen again, we've learned so much about the importance of having a home base. and are excited to continue our build this dream here while also doing what we love most, exploring and seeing the world!{% endraw %}
