Then you don't know what you're missing. Making your own is not only good for the soul -- it's also easy on your pocket. Even with little practice or time, you too can produce super togs, and for good measure, find a real alternative to shopping. Whether you are a beginner or an old hand -- a great tip that will make your job easier never goes astray. Such as the spray adhesive from Prym Consumer. It effortlessly ensures that things stay where you want them for as long as needed without sewing them on. A layer or more of fabric, wool or paper are fixed in an instant at the press of a button -- and if necessary can be repositioned as many times it takes. Ideal if you're looking for the satisfaction of a creative achievement -- using the sandwich or pizza technique, for patchwork or when sewing trendy treats. Spray adhesive -- not to be mistaken with a permanent glue -- is colourless and odourless, easy to wash out and really practical. Simply position the cut parts in the right form, spray on a thin mist of adhesive, place on top of each other, sew together -- done!<br /><br />For more information about the Prym spray adhesive visit:<br />► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.prym.com/en/spray-adhesive-968060">https://www.prym.com/en/spray-adhesive-968060</a><br /><br /><br />Crocheting, knitting and sewing tutorials for beginners and experts?<br /><br />Subscribe to our Prym YouTube channel for more tutorials with Prym products:<br />► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Prym_Abonnieren">http://bit.ly/Prym_Abonnieren</a><br /><br />You can also follow Prym Consumer on:<br />► Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/PrymGlobal">https://www.facebook.com/PrymGlobal</a><br />► Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/Prym.Consumer">https://www.instagram.com/Prym.Consumer</a><br />► Pinterest: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://de.pinterest.com/PrymConsumer">https://de.pinterest.com/PrymConsumer</a>{% endraw %}
