(All total, about 20% of Americans play the lotto). Despite the high number of lotto tickets purchased annually, when playing the lottery (in all its forms), you’ll win an average of just 53 cents for every $1 you spend, making it one of the lowest return rates of any form of commercial gambling, and thus extremely profitable for the various government bodies who run the lotteries.<br /><br />Want the text version?: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2012/12/on-average-people-who-earn-less-than-13000-a-year-in-the-u-s-spend-5-of-their-gross-earnings-on-lottery-tickets/">http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2012/12/on-average-people-who-earn-less-than-13000-a-year-in-the-u-s-spend-5-of-their-gross-earnings-on-lottery-tickets/</a><br /><br />Sources:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?%20%20abstract_id=1324845##">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?%20%20abstract_id=1324845##</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11166-008-9041-1">http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11166-008-9041-1</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://wws.princeton.edu/news/Income_Happiness/Happiness_Money_Report.pdf">http://wws.princeton.edu/news/Income_Happiness/Happiness_Money_Report.pdf</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.smartmoney.com/invest/stocks/why-lottery-winners-go-bankrupt-1301002181742/">http://www.smartmoney.com/invest/stocks/why-lottery-winners-go-bankrupt-1301002181742/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/financialfinesse/2012/04/05/three-ways-not-winning-the-lottery-may-make-you-wealthy/">http://www.forbes.com/sites/financialfinesse/2012/04/05/three-ways-not-winning-the-lottery-may-make-you-wealthy/</a><br /><br />Music from Jukedeck - create your own at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://jukedeck.com.">http://jukedeck.com.</a>{% endraw %}
