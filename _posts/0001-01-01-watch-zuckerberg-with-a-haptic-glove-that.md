It can also close the fingers and place them in a specific position â€” if, for example, the user attempts to catch a ball or touch a hard surface in a VR world.<br /><br />&quot;To allow for this experience, the team is developing 'tactile' gloves: comfortable and adjustable gloves that can reproduce a range of senses in virtual worlds, including texture, pressure and vibration,&quot; according to Meta, a formerly known as Facebook.<br /><br />The main challenge facing the project is the current technological constraints. For example, traditional mechanical actuators can be very heavy and produce too much heat. Thus, Meta Reality Labs, which is behind the creation of this special glove, has developed actuators, made of softer and more flexible materials.<br /><br />Learn more:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.secnews.gr/373716/zuckerberg-glove-virtual-objects/">https://www.secnews.gr/373716/zuckerberg-glove-virtual-objects/</a><br /><br />Follow us:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/SecNews">https://www.facebook.com/SecNews</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/secnews.gr">https://www.instagram.com/secnews.gr</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Secnews_GR">https://twitter.com/Secnews_GR</a>{% endraw %}
