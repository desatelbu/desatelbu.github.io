{% raw %}The expansive new setting of Mexico really does have so much to offer, and longtime players and newcomers alike are sure to have a blast discovering everything you can get stuck into. I've lost count of the amount of races I sped my way through that I immediately wanted to experience all over again. As another fantastic entry in what is already a very strong series, Playground Games delivers impeccably detailed graphics, stellar audio design, and smooth controls that all work together to make Forza Horizon 5 an utter joy to play. I'm already itching to get right back into the driver's seat. <br /><br />00:00 - Forza Horizon 5 Review<br />00:25 - Story &amp; Missions<br />00:49 - Settings<br />00:55 - The driving experience<br />01:45 - The cars<br />02:51 - Character customization<br />03:00 - Gifting<br />03:15 - Mexico and the biggest Forza map ever<br />03:33 - Conclusion<br /><br />#Forza #ForzaHorizon5{% endraw %}
