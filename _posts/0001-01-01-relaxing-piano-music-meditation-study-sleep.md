We can lead our life so as to become more awake to who we are and what we’re doing rather than trying to improve or change or get rid of who we are or what we’re doing. The key is to wake up, to become more alert, more inquisitive and curious about ourselves.<br />**************************************************************************************************<br />INSTAGRAM: eazy_relaxation_soothe<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/eazy_relaxation_soothe/">https://www.instagram.com/eazy_relaxation_soothe/</a><br /><br />Facebook: Eazy Relaxation Soothe <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100070328532865">https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100070328532865</a> <br /><br />#RelaxingMusic #MeditationMusic #SleepMusic #StudyMusic<br /><br />License: Creative Commons Attribution license{% endraw %}
