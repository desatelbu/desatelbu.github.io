{% raw %}Neuroscientists talk about how we have one brain but two minds. We have a mind that acts on impulse and seeks immediate gratification, and we have another mind that controls our impulses and delays gratification to fulfill our long-term goals. We face willpower challenges when the two minds have competing goals. Learn what influences us to procrastinate or why we fail to resist temptation, and learn about small interventions that can have large, positive outcomes.<br /><br /><br /><br />Author and Stanford health psychologist Kelly McGonigal, PhD, talks about strategies from her new book &quot;The WillPower Instinct: How Self-Control Works, Why It Matters, and What You Can Do to Get More of It&quot; as part of the Authors@Google series. Topics include dieting/weight loss, health, addiction, quitting smoking, temptation, procrastination, mindfulness, stress, sleep, cravings, exercise, self-control, self-compassion, guilt, and shame.
