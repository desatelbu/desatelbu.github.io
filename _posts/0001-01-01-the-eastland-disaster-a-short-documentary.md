{% raw %}On the 24th of July, 1915, the SS Eastland – a passenger steamer – capsized in the Chicago River. Conditions at the time were perfectly calm, the water placid. There was no fire, no impact from another ship, no explosion. There was barely even any wind. In fact, the ship was still tied up to the dock. Help was on hand almost instantly. The water was relatively shallow, and the boat didn’t even fully sink. Yet despite all this, the Eastland disaster would turn into one of the deadliest in Chicago’s history.<br /><br />00:00 - Intro<br />00:51 - A History of The Eastland<br />03:00 - The Day of the Disaster<br />07:20 - The Aftermath<br /><br />I tell the true stories behind some of history's greatest disasters... but without sensationalism or disturbing imagery.
