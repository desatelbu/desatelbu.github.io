However, I'm curious to see how much battery this uses because right now having Sentry Mode enabled drains the battery much more quickly than when it‚Äôs turned off so if someone is constantly viewing the live feed, forcing the car to stream the video over the LTE connection might take up more juice.<br /><br />Great news for EVs came last week when Ryan from The Kilowatts YouTube channel &amp; his co-driver Josh set a new EV cannonball record with a Long Range Tesla Model S which means they traveled cross country from New York to California in record time, just over 42 hours which is the fastest for any electric vehicle<br /><br />Since the standard range Model 3 has a 55-kWh battery &amp; the standard range Model Y has 60 kWh, this means the 45 GWh battery order could result in nearly 800,000 Tesla vehicles which is great for anyone looking to get a standard range Tesla without risking long delays with deliveries<br /><br />Any of the new enhanced credits for cars assembled in the United States would not take effect until Jan 1, 2022 and that‚Äôs when most Tesla vehicles sold from then on would be eligible for an $8,000 or $10,000 credit depending on which version gets approved. For the credit on new Teslas, the MSRP cap set by both the House &amp; Senate would result in all Tesla vehicles being eligible except the Model S and Model X. Because the extra $500 or $2,500 credit would not apply until 2022, it could lead to people delaying their purchase until 2022 which is what I‚Äôm doing with my Model Y<br /><br />I ordered my Long Range Model Y in October &amp; since then the price has increased by $3,000 so my suggestion if you want to buy a Tesla &amp; want the largest potential tax credit is to go ahead &amp; order now so you can lock in your price before it possibly increases again. They will be safer due to the structural design but my hope is that the Senate EV tax credit makes it through &amp; I can time it to where I can get a $10,000 credit on my $54,000 Model Y with the brand new 4680 battery which would bring it down to less than $45,000 for what could be in my opinion, the best Tesla ever made up to now. What‚Äôs crazier is the Model Y was only $49,990 earlier this year so the people who ordered it then &amp; have been delaying delivery could possibly delay delivery until the new 4680 Model Y is here &amp; they could get it for less than $40,000 if the $10,000 tax credit is in place<br /><br />As an Amazon Associate &amp; partner for other affiliate programs I earn from qualifying purchases{% endraw %}
