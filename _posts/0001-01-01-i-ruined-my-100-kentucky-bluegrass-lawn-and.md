{% raw %}Are you considering KENTUCKY BLUEGRASS?<br />Before you do, there are a few things to consider…<br />In this video I go over some of the biggest issues I had when seeding 100% Kentucky Bluegrass last season and what I did to fix it.<br /><br />One of the biggest issues I had with 100% Kentucky Bluegrass was excessive bare spots under the drip line of my tree. Anytime I would plant grass seed it would immediately rain and wash out the seed under the tree. Kentucky Bluegrass has the ability to repair itself but unfortunately it didn’t completely repair the bare spots.<br /><br />In order to fix this issue, I decided to overseed my lawn this fall with Perennial Ryegrass and I must say, Im very happy with the results! In less then a week all the bare spots have filled in and im very happy with how the lawn looks now!<br /><br />I have another video where I go over in detail, several downsides of a having a Kentucky Bluegrass Lawn.
