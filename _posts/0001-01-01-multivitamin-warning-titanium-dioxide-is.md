{% raw %}Titanium dioxide dust has been classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as an IARC Group 2B carcinogen when it's inhaled. It's used in sunscreens. It's also used in paint.<br /><br />Take a look at the label of your current multivitamin (of just about any vitamin). There's a good chance the manufacturer used titanium dioxide to make it nice and white so it looks pure. But is simply trying to make something look pure worth it?<br /><br />We don't think so. It's why we developed Pure Vitamin Club and we guarantee that we don't use titanium dioxide in any of our products. <br /><br />See for yourself: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/pvc-titanium">http://bit.ly/pvc-titanium</a>{% endraw %}
