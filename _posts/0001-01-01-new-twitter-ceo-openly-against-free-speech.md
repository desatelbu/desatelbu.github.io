Parag Agrawal, Twitter’s chief technology officer, will take over the helm, the company said Monday.<br /><br />Shares of Twitter closed down 2.74% on the day.<br /><br />Dorsey, 45, was serving as both the CEO of Twitter and Square, his digital payments company. Dorsey will remain a member of the board until his term expires at the 2022 meeting of stockholders, the company said. Salesforce President and COO Bret Taylor will become the chairman of the board, succeeding Patrick Pichette, a former Google executive, who will remain on the board as chair of the audit committee.<br /><br />“I’ve decided to leave Twitter because I believe the company is ready to move on from its founders,” Dorsey said in a statement, though he didn’t provide any additional detail on why he decided to resign.<br /><br />Agrawal, 37, will have to meet Twitter’s aggressive internal goals. The company said earlier this year it aims to have 315 million monetizable daily active users by the end of 2023 and to at least double its annual revenue in that year.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/29/twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-is-expected-to-step-down-sources-say.html">https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/29/twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-is-expected-to-step-down-sources-say.html</a><br /><br />Follow Kyle on Twitter:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/kylekulinski">http://www.twitter.com/kylekulinski</a><br /><br />#KyleKulinski #SecularTalk{% endraw %}
