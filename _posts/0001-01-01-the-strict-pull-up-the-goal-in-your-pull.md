{% raw %}“The goal in your pull-up work is 'more.' You want, you need, more pull-ups. The more you can do, the stronger you become. Muscular endurance, absolute strength, relative strength—whatever you want to define and measure gets better. Every personal-best pull-up is an event worthy of celebration. You’re going to live to be 100, but you’ll not get that many pull-ups, so treat the new ones like birthdays.” —Greg Glassman<br /><br />CrossFit® - Forging Elite Fitness® (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://crossfit.com)">http://crossfit.com)</a><br />The CrossFit Journal -- (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://journal.crossfit.com)">http://journal.crossfit.com)</a><br />The CrossFit Games -- (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://games.crossfit.com)">http://games.crossfit.com)</a><br /><br />The CrossFit Games® - The Sport of Fitness™<br />The Fittest On Earth™{% endraw %}
