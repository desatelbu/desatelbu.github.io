{% raw %}Authorities in Spain's Canary Islands today told residents on the west coast of La Palma to cover doors and windows with duct tape and wet towels to ward off toxic gases spewed by lava from the Cumbre Vieja volcano as it reaches the sea. Lava gushing from the volcano for 10 days flows from a cliff into the sea in the Playa Nueva area near the town of Tazacorte, the Canary Islands Institute of Volcanology confirmed via Twitter. As dawn breaks, red hot lava bulges above the Atlantic Ocean's waterline, sending clouds of vapor and toxic gases into the sky. A cloud of smoke rises from the volcano and molten rock as it flows down the west side of Cumbre Vieja. Everyone within a 2km radius has been evacuated and the wider area under lockdown, Tazacorte Mayor Juan Miguel Rodriguez Acosta told channel TV3, adding that no further evacuations were needed as far as the clouds moved east.{% endraw %}
