{% raw %}US Trial Attorney Todd McMurtry says there are a “number of similarities” in the media’s treatment of Kyle Rittenhouse and Nicholas Sandmann. <br /><br />Kyle Rittenhouse, the 18-year-old who shot and killed two men during racial justice protests in Kenosha, Wisconsin, was found not guilty on all charges last week. <br /><br />Nick Sandmann received media scrutiny when a viral video of him being confronted by a Native American in 2019 while Mr Sandmann wore a ‘Make America Great Again’ hat. <br /><br />“In each circumstance they were initially attacked by the media when they were under the age of 18 or under the age of majority here, in the United States,” Mr McMurtry told Sky News host Andrew Bolt. <br /><br />“In both circumstances, these were young boys, young men and they were viciously attacked by the media, so I think that is the primary similarity. <br /><br />“Another important similarity is that in both circumstances there were many facts stated about each which ultimately proved to be untrue.”{% endraw %}
