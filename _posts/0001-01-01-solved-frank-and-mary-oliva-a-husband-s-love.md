{% raw %}The search for Frank and Mary Oliva (missing person cold case documentary) could be over when this search takes AWP to Wilber Nebraska in hopes of solving the mysterious disappearance from July 28, 1971 when neighbors saw the couple come home between 8:00 and 9:00 that evening, just as it was getting dark, only to leave a few minutes later with Mary wearing nothing more than her housecoat. <br /><br />The Olivas have never been heard from again.<br /><br />Mary suffered from heart problems, high blood pressure and memory problems at the time of her disappearance, and she was also reportedly depressed. <br /><br />She had dental surgery days before her disappearance, required medication for her heart condition, pain medication for the dental surgery, both of which she left behind.<br /><br />Authorities and Frank Jr. (Frank and Mary's only living child at the time) believe the Olivas died by suicide together. <br /><br />The theory is that Frank Sr. drove their car into a water-filled sandpit because he felt he was unable to take care of Mary any longer. <br /><br />He was depressed over Mary's health and had said repeatedly that he would not put his wife in a nursing home. <br /><br />Investigators searched nearby sandpits but didn't come up with any evidence.<br /><br />This video documents our search in Wilber, Nebraska for Frank and Mary Oliva. <br /><br />HOW CAN YOU HELP AWP?<br />========<br />üéØ Subscribe to AWP (It's Free)...‚û§ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/SubAWP">http://bit.ly/SubAWP</a><br />üëï AWP Merch and Donations..‚û§ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://adventureswithpurpose.com">https://adventureswithpurpose.com</a><br />üé¨ GET VIDEOS EARLY (Become a Member)... ‚û§ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/AWP-Team-Member">http://bit.ly/AWP-Team-Member</a><br /><br />HOW IS AWP FUNDED?... ‚û§ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/wz1dCguO2y0">https://youtu.be/wz1dCguO2y0</a><br /><br />SUBSCRIBE TO OTHERS ON THE TEAM<br />‚òû Subscribe to Doug..‚û§ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/DougBishop">http://bit.ly/DougBishop</a><br />‚òû Sub to Josh..‚û§ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/SubJoshCantu">https://bit.ly/SubJoshCantu</a><br />‚òû Carson on Instagram..‚û§ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/CarsonOnInstagram">https://bit.ly/CarsonOnInstagram</a><br /><br />Josh‚Äôs Behind-the-Scenes<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/srhIwpwYZD8">https://youtu.be/srhIwpwYZD8</a><br /><br />Questions?<br />Email: support@adventureswithpurpose.com<br />==================<br /><br />ADDITIONAL DETAILS ABOUT THE CASE<br />Their daughter-in-law, Shirley, came by after she found out they hadn't been seen for a week and their newspapers and milk deliveries had been piling up. <br /><br />The front door was closed but unlocked, nothing appeared to be out of place at their house, and Mary had left behind two bottles of medicine and her black purse, which she always carried with her. <br /><br />Only their beige 1958 Chevrolet 210 with the license plate number 225-910 was missing.<br /><br />Frank was born in Czechoslovakia. He moved to the United States at the age of seventeen and became a mason, carpenter and farmer. <br /><br />Mary is a Nebraska native. <br /><br />The Olivas moved to Wilber in 1957; many Czech immigrants lived in the town and they held a Czech Festival very year. <br /><br />After his retirement, Frank continued to take odd jobs in the area. Mary appeared to be happy in Wilber and she enjoyed working in her garden and playing bingo on weekends.<br /><br />Mary's son by her first marriage died in 1959, and in 1960 the couple's daughter died of polio. Only one child, their son Frank Jr., remained. Mary's health was declining by 1973 and Shirley, Frank Jr.'s wife, came over frequently to help out around the house.<br /><br />What do you think happened to Frank and Mary?<br /><br />Hug the ones you love for you never know when it might be the last time you see them. <br /><br />We are humbled by the opportunity all of you have given us to help in the search for answers as to what happened to Frank and Mary.<br /><br />The AWP Movement would not be possible without your support, helping us travel the US offering our services for FREE to families searching for their lost loved ones...
