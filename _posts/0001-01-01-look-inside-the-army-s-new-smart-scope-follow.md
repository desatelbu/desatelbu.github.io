It calculates where to display the reticle after you press the button. This works for machine guns, rifles, sniper rifles. L3 Harris created the 1-6x magnification optic. It includes Target Reference Point features as well as the ability to laser range find. Its like having a range card in front of you so you can re find old targets.<br /><br />Task &amp; Purpose is a military news and culture oriented channel.
