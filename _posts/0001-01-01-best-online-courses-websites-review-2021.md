{% raw %}Best Online Courses Websites Review 2021ðŸ”¥<br />Hello to all self-education lovers. Today I will tell you everything I know about using this service to increase your intelligence. Nonprofit organization Khan Academy makes its online courses free for all. It focuses primarily on content for students in the US schools, but it's a reliable source for anyone with a hunger to learn.<br />Where can you go online to learnâ€”not just learn to solve an immediate problem, but advance your understanding of a topic or start studying something from scratch? <br />For most academic subjects, the best place is Khan Academy. Khan Academy is a free online learning service with course material covering math, science, art history, and other subjects. The lessons contain videos, readings, and interactive components, which are sequenced so that you can start from square one with any subject and slowly build your knowledge.<br />In July 2020, the site announced it would concentrate more acutely on kindergarten through early college courses and was thus retiring materials that fall outside that scope. <br />There are some small gaps in the content catalog; Khan doesn't offer classes in music, music appreciation, or foreign languages, for example. It does, however, offer its courses to speakers of other languages, namely, Spanish, French, and Brazilian Portuguese. In other words, you can take Algebra I taught in Spanish rather than English. Support for more languages is in the works. Given what it offers and the fact that it's entirely free to use, Khan Academy is the best learning site for academic subjects and an Editors' Choice.<br />Khan Academy started when its founder, Sal Khan, began tutoring his cousin. At the time, Khan was a financial analyst. He recorded videos of a virtual blackboard with voice-over narrations to explain different concepts in mathematics to his cousin. He began posting these lessons on YouTube.{% endraw %}
