{% raw %}6PR broadcaster Oliver Peterson says supply chain issues in the lead up to Christmas could cause a “huge dent in Santa's stocking”.  <br /><br />The Australian Financial Review is reporting Christmas supply chains are under threat as Toll warehouse workers - including at Kmart’s biggest distribution centre - strike indefinitely in a fight for higher pay. <br /><br />“I mean you go to most Kmarts or Targets around the country right now and they’re pretty much bare as it is because everybody’s been spending money,” Mr Peterson told Sky News host Jenna Clarke.  <br /><br />“It’s timely now if you want to take the action, to do it in the middle of November, just don’t do it a week or two into December please.”{% endraw %}
