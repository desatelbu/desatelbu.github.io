{% raw %}When Veteran David came home after 20 years of service in the military, he knew he needed a little help from a furry friend while acclimating to civilian life. That’s when David found K9s For Warriors and met his loving pup, Doc. <br /> <br />David and Doc saved each other. It’s been all love and cuddles, and they’ve been completely inseparable ever since they graduated from the K9s For Warriors program. <br /> <br />Sponsored by GEICO<br /><br />For more awesome pet content from GEICO, visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://on.gei.co/38yJ8If.">https://on.gei.co/38yJ8If.</a><br /> <br />To follow the adventures of more veterans and their service animals, you can keep up with them on Instagram: @k9sforwarriors<br /><br />Introducing Dodo swag!  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shop.thedodo.com/">https://shop.thedodo.com/</a><br /><br />Love Animals?
