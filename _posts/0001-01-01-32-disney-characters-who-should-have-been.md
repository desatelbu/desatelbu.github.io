I can deliver solo talks on a specific topic and/or moderate or sit on group panels. I have previously spoken on topics including:<br /><br />- Building Inclusive Communities<br /><br />- Using YouTube for social good and charitable efforts<br /><br />- LGBTQ+ Representation on TV/Film<br /><br />- LGBTQ+ History<br /><br />- Pop culture and Feminism<br /><br />- Writing Strong Female Characters<br /><br />- Women on YouTube<br /><br />- How to use YouTube/social media as a tool in your career.  <br /><br />- &amp; many more.{% endraw %}
