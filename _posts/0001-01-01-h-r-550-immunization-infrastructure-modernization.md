No government should have access to these records. The data they seek to gain access to must remain private.<br /><br />The US government now wants to start gathering data about immunization status and history of its citizens. The classification of a population has begun. I Please flood your politicians with your thoughts about such an egregious overreach of power. The politicians work FOR US. They are only in power because we have granted them their positions through voting (or lack of voting).<br /><br />This cannot continue. Other countries who have enacted universal, government-run healthcare have already fallen prey to such despicable acts. The time to take action to preserve your health information freedom is now.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />covid covid19 vaccine vaccination vaccinations immunity immunization pfizer moderna biontech mnra congress congressmen genocide congresswomen congressman congresswoman missouri health freedom humanity first stage classify{% endraw %}
