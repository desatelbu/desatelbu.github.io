{% raw %}Animals can do some pretty crazy things, but some things are more shocking than others. From a life-saving cat and an unexpected thief to a mom just trying to make sure her kid has a fun time here are 15 animal moments that, if not film, you wouldn’t believe! <br /><br />► Subscribe For New Videos! ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/XPOHAZ">https://goo.gl/XPOHAZ</a><br /><br />Watch our “If They Knew They Were On Camera, This Would Have Never Happened”<br />video here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/eWQLn6d3h5Q">https://youtu.be/eWQLn6d3h5Q</a><br />Watch our “20 Animals Who Messed With The Wrong Opponent”<br />video here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/5z9I_17EE_Q">https://youtu.be/5z9I_17EE_Q</a><br />Watch our “15 Animals Who Eat Their Own Kind!”<br />video here:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/3HGXQqgYXpQ">https://youtu.be/3HGXQqgYXpQ</a><br /><br />Supercat <br /><br />Dogs are generally labeled as “man’s best friend” and cats are regarded as the animals that don’t really care about their owners. Sure, they seem that way, but every now and then, some cats break character to show you that they’re not all that bad. Not only do they care, but they’ll also step in if they’re needed, which is exactly what happened here. When a neighbor’s dog decided he wanted to attack a 4-year-old boy on his tricycle, it looked like he wasn’t going to make it out of the encounter safely, but that wasn’t going to happen under their family cat, Tara’s watch! Tara leaped into action and knocked the dog off the child. She even chased it away before turning back to check up on the boy!  Even though the boy needed 10 stitches, because of his cat’s amazing reflexes and quick thinking, he was able to make a full recovery! <br /><br />Lion checking in <br /><br />There’s a reason why Safaris have a rule that you need to keep your windows up, and your doors locked. People often think “who’s going to come into my car in the middle of a jungle?” Well, the animals! Even though Safari animals look like they’re “out in the wild” they’ve seen enough cars and people to know that they’re not actually in the wild, and with that, have adapted to new ways of getting food. One of these is by literally opening your car door to get it, which is exactly what happened to this family as they made their way through a bunch of lions! Next time you’re at a safari, remember to lock your doors, or you might become a type of snack you really don’t wanna be!<br /><br /><br />Follow Us On Social Media <br /><br /><br /><br />Twitter <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/FactsJunkieYT">https://twitter.com/FactsJunkieYT</a><br /><br />Facebook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/FactsJunkieYT">https://www.facebook.com/FactsJunkieYT</a><br /><br /><br /><br />► For copyright issues, send us an email at : factsjunkie@gmail.com{% endraw %}
