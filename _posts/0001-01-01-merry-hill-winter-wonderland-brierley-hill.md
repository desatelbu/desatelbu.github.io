{% raw %}We took the short trip down to Brierley Hill for the opening night of the Merry Hill Winter Wonderland , And did we pick the wrong night to visit as the weather was so bad and kept opening night quiet  and we only just got finished before the worst storm of 2021 hit the UK,  that said we had a brilliant evening at a really good event ,  fantastic line up of rides including High Roller, The always brilliant Polar Express, cox's waltzer, Cornelius Gooch's Extreme , Ross Kayes brilliant Twister with one of the best ops on the Mic , Wayne Robinsons brilliant Tagada ,  jungle paratrooper , Speedway Superbob , a brilliant cycle on XLR8 booster and much more,  loads of food stalls , kids rides ,  Santa says hello from his grotto and a cracking Bar area for the adults .  All in all a fantastic event and well worth you getting down to visit.{% endraw %}
