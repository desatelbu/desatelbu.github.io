{% raw %}The Minecraft community have generated so much content on YouTube, that when the trillionth click was clacked this video appeared. Welcome to a world that the community inspired, with their seemingly endless creativity and love for a little game about blocks. A trillion views means A LOT of content, so we couldnâ€™t fit it all in there but can you spot all the references in our #Minecraftmuseum? Be warned, you might have to watch it a trillion times to catch them all.{% endraw %}
