{% raw %}Cessna Cardinal 2214Y is Getting a new interior!     This Cessna Cardinal is long overdue for a new interior and we will being with redoing the front seats.  The seats, as well as the rest of the interior, came from Aritex and it was all reasonably priced.<br /><br />I will get to the costs of this later on in the program, but  it wasn’t really that bad. The best part of this is that this project is something that you can do yourself.  It really doesn’t require any special skills except the willingness to figure it out.<br /><br />The total cost for the interior was about $3500.00.   The seats were 1500 for all four.  The seas came together pretty quickly, actually in about 4 days from start to finish and a lot of that time was glue and pint drying.   <br /><br />I got the 1968 Cessna Cardinal interior from airtex. Everything came in a few boxes, very well organized with everything I need.  They have instructions that you download from their site and it couldn’t be any easier.   Everything you need is included.  This actually was a lot easier than I thought it would be.<br /><br />Yes! I bought an airplane! This program has some initial numbers and breaks down the monthly expenses. Owning an airplane can be affordable... but the upgrades....  That is what will get me.  Watch this program to find out what ownership costs.<br /><br />Have you always wanted to learn how to fly but now you are over 50?  Get out there and start and learn! There are so many people in there 50's and 60's who are just starting to fly so what are you waiting for?{% endraw %}
