{% raw %}We sat down with New Jersey based pop punk band Halogens to ask one question: If you were stranded on a desert island, what's the ONE album you would bring with you? They responded with answers all across the board - from double albums to stand up comedy.<br /><br />Stream Halogens' new album 'You're Being Weird' out on Refresh Records here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://halogensnj.bandcamp.com/">https://halogensnj.bandcamp.com/</a><br /><br /><br />Direction/Editing: Madison Van Houten<br />B-Cam/Assistant: Abby Clare<br />Special Thanks to DIMM Studios in Freehold, NJ{% endraw %}
