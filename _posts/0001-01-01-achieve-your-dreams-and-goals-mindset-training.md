This time for the Pyrenees hooded running shirt, it’s a shirt that I wear daily too. (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pathprojects.com/pyrenees)">https://pathprojects.com/pyrenees)</a><br /><br />Although the gear is developed based on a men’s body type, many women run in this gear as well. For example a men’s XS shirt is a women’s size medium. <br /><br />Full disclosure, I’m one of the owners of this company. That being said, it’s the only running clothing that I wear.
