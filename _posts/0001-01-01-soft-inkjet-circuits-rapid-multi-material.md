{% raw %}Despite  the  increasing  popularity  of  soft  interactive  devices, their  fabrication  remains  complex  and  time consuming. We contribute  a process  for  rapid  do-it-yourself  fabrication  of soft  circuits  using a  conventional  desktop inkjet  printer. It supports  inkjet  printing  of  circuits  that  are stretchable,ultra-thin,high resolution, and integrated with a wide variety of materials used for prototyping.We introduce multi-ink functional  printing  on  a  desktop  printer  for realizing multi-material devices, including conductive and isolating inks. We further present DIY techniques  to enhance compatibility  be-tween  inks  and  substrates  and  the  circuitsâ€™  elasticity.  This enables  circuits  on  a wide  set of  materials  including  temporary tattoo paper, textiles, and thermoplastic. Four application cases demonstrate  versatile  uses  for realizing  stretchable de-vices, e-textiles, body-based and re-shapeable interfaces.{% endraw %}
