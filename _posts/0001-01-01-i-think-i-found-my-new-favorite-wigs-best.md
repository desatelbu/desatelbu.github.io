{% raw %}Hey loves! Today I'm trying on wigs from Radswan. These are some of the most realistic synthetic wigs on the market. Including pre-plucked hairline, no shine and lightweight premium fibers. They are also the creators of the Radgrip, which is an alternative to gluing your wigs down and won't damage your hairline. Let me know which wig from the video was your favorite!<br /><br />PRODUCTS IN VIDEO:<br /><br />RS04 - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://radswan.com/products/radshape-04?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=video&amp;utm_campaign=jessica_pettway&amp;utm_id=Jessica+Pettway">https://radswan.com/products/radshape-04?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=video&amp;utm_campaign=jessica_pettway&amp;utm_id=Jessica+Pettway</a><br /><br />RS02: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://radswan.com/products/radshape-02?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=video&amp;utm_campaign=jessica_pettway&amp;utm_id=Jessica+Pettway">https://radswan.com/products/radshape-02?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=video&amp;utm_campaign=jessica_pettway&amp;utm_id=Jessica+Pettway</a><br /><br /> <br />SHOP MORE WIGS:<br />Radswan: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://radswan.com/?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=video&amp;utm_campaign=jessica_pettway&amp;utm_id=Jessica+Pettway">https://radswan.com/?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=video&amp;utm_campaign=jessica_pettway&amp;utm_id=Jessica+Pettway</a><br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------<br />CONNECT WITH ME: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/jessicapettway/">https://instagram.com/jessicapettway/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/JessicaPettwayOfficial/">https://www.facebook.com/JessicaPettwayOfficial/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/jessicapettwayy">https://www.twitter.com/jessicapettwayy</a><br /><br />For business inquiries please contact<br />jessica@imageiseverything.co with “Jessica Pettway” in the subject line<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------<br />EQUIPMENT USED:<br />Camera - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/1DcS6os">http://amzn.to/1DcS6os</a><br />Lighting- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/1Mq5pqD">http://amzn.to/1Mq5pqD</a><br />Editing software- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/1SjJy60">http://amzn.to/1SjJy60</a><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />FTC: Some of these links are affiliate links that I make a small commission percentage off of.
