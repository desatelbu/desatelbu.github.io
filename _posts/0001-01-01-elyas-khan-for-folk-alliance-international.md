{% raw %}Thought I would try an all acoustic set recorded in Berlin at home, creaky floorboards and all. Representing Brooklyn Americana Music Festival which founded by the great Jan Bell in DUMBO Brooklyn where lived and worked for many years.<br />Featuring Melissa Fowler as The Guiding Light.<br />Shot and edited by Martin Mostert<br />All songs by Elyas Khan <br /><br />In place of an in-person conference this year, FAI is hosting Folk Unlocked, a five-day virtual event for the entire international folk community to come together for panels, workshops, showcases, affinity and peer group meetings, exhibit spaces, networking, and mentorship. We are unlocking the doors and windows of the house of folk to be as broad and inclusive as possible, inviting those who have been loyally attending Folk Alliance International conferences for years while aiming to reach folk musicians and professionals who have never benefited from or attended FAI before.<br /><br /> <br /><br />This is a year for innovation and creativity, and we will host a space for community building and career development for everyone from the comfort and safety of their own home. We hope to push the boundaries of what our community can achieve with technology, and though this means not every aspect of our typical annual conference will be able to exist in this format, weâ€™re excited for this opportunity to initiate a new way of connection.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://folkunlocked.pathable.co/">https://folkunlocked.pathable.co/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.bkamf.com/">http://www.bkamf.com/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.elyaskhan.com/">https://www.elyaskhan.com/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/elyaskhanmusic/">https://www.facebook.com/elyaskhanmusic/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/elyas_khan_music/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/elyas_khan_music/?hl=en</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Elyas_Khan?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">https://twitter.com/Elyas_Khan?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor</a>{% endraw %}
