{% raw %}Coffee Talk | Wellness Month, The Road to Health &amp; Happiness | Sanne Vloet<br /><br />Hi Friends!<br /><br />Happy Monday! Did you celebrate Halloween? If yes how was it? :)   I went out with some friends on Friday. We did a group costume this years as &quot; Things&quot;  which was  a lot of fun! I was only able to do one night out haha because after I felt I had to recover the whole weekend. <br /><br />Anyway, its an exciting beginning of November because Wellness Month has started! I am so excited to take you with on a journey of Health, Wellness &amp; Happiness. Some of you have been joining me in the last couple of years and some of you are new to the channel!
