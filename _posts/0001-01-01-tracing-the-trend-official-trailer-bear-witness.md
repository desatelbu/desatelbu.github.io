{% raw %}Check out Tracing The Trend, my episode from the new YouTube Original, Bear Witness, Take Action 3 where I trace how Hip-hop culture has impacted Asian youth culture. My friends, Guapdad 4000, Sophia Chang and Danyel Smith join me to analyze the origins of main stream trends across music and fashion in an attempt to give credit where credit is due. Tracing the Trend premieres December 6th, only on YouTube. <br /><br /><br />Bear Witness, Take Action 3 is the latest YouTube Original from The Black Voices Fund, a fund dedicated to amplifying Black Voices, stories and culture.
