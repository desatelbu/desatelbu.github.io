{% raw %}Enjoy as ðŸ¥¼ Dr. Jochen squeezes every bit of this cyst that looks like some hot Grits! <br /><br />A cyst is an abnormal closed, hollow, and membranous sac filled with air, bodily fluids, keratin, and/or pus if the cyst has ever been infected. There are many different kinds of cysts, almost all of which are benign and do not require medical intervention unless they rupture, become infected, are very large, or are painful.<br /><br /><br /><br />Follow Us:<br />Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/ContourDermatology/">https://www.facebook.com/ContourDermatology/</a><br />Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/contourderm/">https://www.instagram.com/contourderm/</a><br />Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/contourderm/">https://twitter.com/contourderm/</a><br />LinkedIn - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/contour-dermatology-&amp;-cosmetic-surgery-center">https://www.linkedin.com/company/contour-dermatology-&amp;-cosmetic-surgery-center</a><br />Snapchat - @contourderm<br />Pinterest - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pinterest.com/contourderm760/">https://www.pinterest.com/contourderm760/</a>{% endraw %}
