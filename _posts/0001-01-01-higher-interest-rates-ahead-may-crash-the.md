{% raw %}WATCH PART 2 (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/S4cLPkt7J3Q)">https://youtu.be/S4cLPkt7J3Q)</a> &amp; then SCHEDULE YOUR FREE PORTFOLIO REVIEW with Wealthion's endorsed financial advisors at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.wealthion.com/">https://www.wealthion.com/</a><br /><br />Right now we're living in a world of all-time high asset prices -- just look at stocks, housing and cryptocurrencies to name just a few. They've all rocketed higher in 2021. Wages are suddenly rising faster than they have in many years, too.<br /><br />Are these the new Roaring 20's? Will we enjoy a prolonged period of prosperity from here?<br /><br />Or is the current party not sustainable? <br /><br />Skeptics worry that spiking inflation, fast-slowing economic growth, accelerating wealth inequality, snarled supply chains, energy shortages, too much leverage and too much financialization are putting the system at danger of another reckoning like the Great Recession.<br /><br />Who's likely to be proven right? The optimists or the skeptics?<br /><br />To delve deep with us into this is Stephanie Pomboy, founder of MacroMavens, a pre-eminent economic research firm, and one of my most favorite people to interview.<br /><br />At Wealthion, we show you how to protect and build your wealth by learning from the world’s top experts on finance and money. Each week we add new videos that provide you with access to the foremost specialists in investing, economics, the stock market, real estate and personal finance.<br /><br />We offer exceptional interviews and explainer videos that dive deep into the trends driving today's markets, the economy, and your own net worth. We give you strategies for financial security, practical answers to questions like “how to grow my investments?”, and effective solutions for wealth building tailored to 'regular' investors just like you.<br /><br />There’s no doubt that it's a very challenging time right now for the average investor. Above and beyond the recent economic impacts of COVID, the new era of record low interest rates, runaway US debt and US deficits, and trillions of dollars in monetary and fiscal stimulus stimulus has changed the rules of investing by dangerously distorting the Dow index, the S&amp;P 500, and nearly all other asset prices. Can prices keep rising, or is there a painful reckoning ahead? <br /><br />Let us help you prepare your portfolio just in case the future brings one or more of the following: inflation, deflation, a bull market, a bear market, a market correction, a stock market crash, a real estate bubble, a real estate crash, an economic boom, a recession, a depression, or another global financial crisis.<br /><br />Put the wisdom from the money &amp; markets experts we feature on Wealthion into action by scheduling a free consultation with Wealthion’s endorsed financial advisors, who will work with you to determine the right next steps for you to take in building your wealth.<br /><br />SCHEDULE YOUR FREE WEALTH CONSULTATION with Wealthion's endorsed financial advisors here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.wealthion.com/">https://www.wealthion.com/</a><br /><br />Subscribe to our YouTube channel <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKMeK-HGHfUFFArZ91rzv5A?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKMeK-HGHfUFFArZ91rzv5A?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />Follow us on Facebook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Wealthion-109680281218040">https://www.facebook.com/Wealthion-109680281218040</a><br /><br />#interestrates #Fed #inflation<br />____________________________________<br />IMPORTANT NOTE: The information and opinions offered in this video by Wealthion or its interview guests are for educational purposes ONLY and should NOT be construed as personal financial advice.
