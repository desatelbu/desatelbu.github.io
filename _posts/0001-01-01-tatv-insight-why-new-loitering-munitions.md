{% raw %}A new family of smart-loitering drones from the UAE’s Edge is giving a new dimension to the country’s armed forces.<br /><br />In this programme we look at the capabilities of individual members of the QX family of munitions.<br />Loitering munition – or more popularly the suicide or kamikaze drone. are proving to be  important part of today’s armed forces capability. They were originally developed as a defence against surface to air missiles but now have various roles to meet today’s threats.<br /><br />The smart drone can loiter around a target area for some time, searches for targets, and attacks once a target is located. They enable faster reaction times against concealed or hidden targets that emerge for short periods without placing high-value platforms close to the target area, and also allow more selective targeting as the actual attack mission can be aborted and the drone can return to base.<br /><br />Edge unveiled the QX family at last month’s IDEX defence show in Abu Dhabi where the TATV team met up with Miles Chambers, director of business development at EDGE and asked him to introduce us to the family.{% endraw %}
