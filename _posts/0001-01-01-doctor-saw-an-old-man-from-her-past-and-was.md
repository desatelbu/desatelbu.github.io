{% raw %}#savepatient #clinic #onechance<br /><br />Imagine a situation in which you go from the most prominent person in town to a nobody in just an instant. That is exactly the fate our hero suffered…<br /><br />A doctor from a local hospital arrived to start her morning shift when she saw a group of people by the entrance to the hospital. She approached them and realized that they had surrounded an old man who lying on the ground. A security guard didn’t allow the man to enter the hospital, and now he was on the verge of passing if he didn’t get the help he needed.<br /><br />Upon taking a closer look at him, the doctor recognized the man who had one day turned her life upside down. A second later, she was rushing down the hospital corridor, pushing a gurney with the man who was now barely breathing… That’s when the most interesting part begins.{% endraw %}
