{% raw %}Hey guys! The Toronto snowfall season is here! This Toronto 4k walking video was filmed on November 28 2021 in Toronto's Greektown neighbourhood, starting off on Pape Ave near Pape Subway Station.<br /><br />After checking some of Danforth Ave, and the shops and restaurants lining the street, I continued my walk around the area by heading northbound into some of the residential areas. I went north along Logan Ave and took a look around the houses and the mature trees that were covered in snow. It really was amazing to see the snow on the trees and structures.<br /><br />I walked back down to Danforth Ave and continued west along the street until reaching Danforth Ave and Broadview Ave.<br /><br />Thanks for watching!<br /><br />00:10 - South on Pape Ave near Pape Subway Station and heading to Danforth Ave<br />1:10 - Pape Ave and Danforth ave and heading westbound on Danforth Ave<br />2:00 - An elevated look at Danforth Ave from some church steps<br />3:00 - A look at the storefronts<br />3:40 - Danforth and Carlaw Ave<br />6:05 - A street preacher at the corner of Danforth and Logan and heading north on Logan Ave<br />11:50 - South on Arundel Ave and seeing the beautiful mature trees covered in snow (and houses )<br />17:27 - west on Danforth Ave and seeing the storefronts<br />19:53 - crossing to the south side of Danforth and continuing west<br />20:33 - Dogs enjoying the snow<br />23:25 - Passing the Danforth Music Hall<br />25:00 - Arriving at Danforth Ave and Broadview Ave{% endraw %}
