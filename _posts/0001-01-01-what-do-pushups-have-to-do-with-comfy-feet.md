{% raw %}You can learn what it takes to have TRULY comfortable shoes by thinking about pushups!<br /><br />How?<br /><br />Think about this: when you do a pushup, do you squeeze your fingers together?<br /><br />Of course not. <br /><br />You spread them apart for stability, balance, and force production... which can help you get stronger.<br /><br />Well, your feet are no different.<br /><br />Your toes aren't supposed to be bunched up and squeezed, but most shoes have POINTY toe boxes that don't let your toes move naturally... so it's more like doing a pushup with your fingers squeezed together.<br /><br />Xero Shoes have wider, foot-shaped toe boxes... plus these other design elements that &quot;let your feet be feet&quot; and you have natural comfort and performance:<br /><br />- Natural Fit -- wide toe boxes let your toes spread and relax. A non-elevated (zero-drop) heel for proper posture.<br />- Natural Motion -- super flexible to let your feet bend and move naturally. Low-to-the-ground for balance and agility.<br />- Natural Feel -- the patented FeelTrueÂ® soles give you just-right protection while still giving the ground feedback your brain needs for efficient, natural movement.<br /><br />Plus they're affordable and so durable that they have a 5,000 mile sole warranty.<br /><br />Your feet are made to bend, flex, move and FEEL the world. One-quarter of the bones and joints in your ENTIRE body are in your feet and ankles; you have more nerve endings in your soles than anywhere but your finger tips and lips. <br /><br />Let your feet do what's natural and Live Life Feet First -- go to <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://xeroshoes.com">https://xeroshoes.com</a>{% endraw %}
