{% raw %}Large Audience Events provide an unparalleled opportunity to peek behind the curtain and experience the energy and momentum that only a group of this size can bring. These are great events if it’s your first time exploring a spiritual connection in this way. But even if you attend regularly, be prepared to witness profoundly detailed validations of communication from the other side – maybe for yourself!<br /><br />New Inspirational videos will be posted every Monday.<br />Subscribe to the channel here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2xbBGUO">http://bit.ly/2xbBGUO</a><br /><br />_____<br />You can follow Rebecca at:<br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://rebeccarosen.com/blog/">http://rebeccarosen.com/blog/</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/mediumrebecc...">https://www.facebook.com/mediumrebecc...</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/mediumrebec...">https://www.instagram.com/mediumrebec...</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/rebeccarosen">https://twitter.com/rebeccarosen</a><br /><br />For the past two decades, I have served as an ambassador between the spirit world and our day-to-day world—relaying wisdom and insight from angels, guides and those who have passed on to people seeking answers in the here and now. <br /><br />Now I travel the country, empowering people to take charge of their own happiness by communicating messages, inspiration and insight from what I call “Team Spirit”.<br /><br />The path that got me here wasn’t easy, but it’s one I’m grateful to have traveled.
