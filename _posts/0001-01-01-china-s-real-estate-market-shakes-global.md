Some expressed worry about where China's economy is headed. In this video, we address the following:<br />1) What's the major economic story coming out of China today?<br />2) Because of the Real Estate crisis, mainly that of Evergrande, will some investors get the key to their new homes?<br />3) What are the concerns of the Ruling/Communist Party?<br />4)Will investors trust the Chinese market? <br /><br />One thing is sure: Many around the world see the Real Estate market in China as a ‘Modern Chinese Tragedy’. Beijing needs to resolve this issue, sooner than later, I hope. <br /><br />link to article: China’s GDP Growth Slows to 4.9% Amid Power Crunch, Real Estate Woes<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.caixinglobal.com/2021-10-18/chinas-gdp-growth-slows-to-49-101787894.html">https://www.caixinglobal.com/2021-10-18/chinas-gdp-growth-slows-to-49-101787894.html</a><br /><br />Links to my books: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/David-S.-Oualaalou/e/B0711CDMCJ%3Fref=dbs_a_mng_rwt_scns_share%C3%82%C2%A0Subscribe">https://www.amazon.com/David-S.-Oualaalou/e/B0711CDMCJ%3Fref=dbs_a_mng_rwt_scns_share%C3%82%C2%A0Subscribe</a> to our Instagram:@GeopoliticsInConflict<br />Subscribe to our Blog: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.globalperspectiveconsulting.com/blog">https://www.globalperspectiveconsulting.com/blog</a><br />Follow us on Rumble: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rumble.com/c/c-1063611?duration=long">https://rumble.com/c/c-1063611?duration=long</a><br />Follow us on Odysee: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://odysee.com/@GeopoliticsInConflict:6">https://odysee.com/@GeopoliticsInConflict:6</a><br />Follow us on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/doualaalou">https://twitter.com/doualaalou</a>{% endraw %}
