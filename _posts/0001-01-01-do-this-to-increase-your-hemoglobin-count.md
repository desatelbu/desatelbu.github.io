This explains why those with iron deficiency anemia tend to have a low hemoglobin count. Therefore, in order to increase the amount of iron in the body, you can try to add more iron-rich foods to your diet. <br /><br />🟦 Some examples include:<br />- Broccoli<br />- Kale<br />- Spinach<br />- Cabbage<br />- Beef<br />- Beans<br />- Lentils<br />- Shellfish<br /><br />➡️ Eat Foods That are High in Folate<br />Folate is a type of B vitamin that the body uses to produce more hemoglobin within the blood. Without this critical vitamin, your red blood cells will not be able to develop and mature as they normally would.<br /><br />🟦 Some examples include:<br />- Spinach<br />- Lettuce<br />- Avocado<br />- Beans<br />- Peanuts <br />- Beef<br /><br />➡️ Take Iron Supplements<br />Before doing so, please check with your doctor first because they will know more about your individual medical condition. Having an iron deficiency is one of the leading causes of a low hemoglobin count.<br /><br />➡️ Maximize Iron Absorption<br />We've already established that it's important to increase your iron intake because it's directly correlated with hemoglobin production. Once iron has been consumed, it needs to be absorbed rather than being flushed back out of the body and wasted away. One effective way to maximize iron absorption is to make sure that your body is getting plenty of vitamin C.<br /><br />🟦 Some foods that are high in vitamin A include:<br />- Kale<br />- Spinach<br />- Fish<br />- Liver<br />- Squash <br />- Sweet potatoes<br /><br />🟦 Some foods that are high in beta-carotene include:<br />- Carrots<br />- Squash<br />- Mangos<br />- Cantaloupes<br />- Sweet potatoes<br /><br />➡️ Avoid Iron Blockers<br />An iron blocker is a type of nutrient that decreases iron absorption within the body. This is the opposite of what we're striving for in those with an iron deficiency. <br /><br />🟦 Some examples of iron blockers include:<br />- Calcium<br />- Phytates<br />- Oxylates<br /><br />➡️ Drink Nettle Leaf Tea<br />I already mentioned that many types of herbal teas actually block iron absorption. Thankfully, nettle leaf tea is not included. The nettle leaf comes from an herb that has been used in traditional medicine in many cultures around the world.<br /><br />💥Best Foods for Arteries [Full Guide] ➜ ➜ ➜ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3wTwlwC">https://bit.ly/3wTwlwC</a><br /><br />—————<br /><br />💙MORE FROM RTZ<br />▪ Free TMC Practice Exam 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2XlwASL">http://bit.ly/2XlwASL</a><br />▪ Free RRT Cheat Sheet 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2IbmOKB">http://bit.ly/2IbmOKB</a><br />▪ Resources for RT's 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2WVV5qo">http://bit.ly/2WVV5qo</a><br />▪ Testimonials 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2x7b5Gl">http://bit.ly/2x7b5Gl</a><br /><br />🌐FOLLOW US<br />▪ Instagram 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2FhF0jV">http://bit.ly/2FhF0jV</a><br />▪ Twitter 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2ZsS6T1">http://bit.ly/2ZsS6T1</a><br />▪ Facebook 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2MSEejt">http://bit.ly/2MSEejt</a><br />▪ Pinterest 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2ZwVLPw">http://bit.ly/2ZwVLPw</a><br /><br />🚑MEDICAL DISCLAIMER<br />This content is for educational and informational purposes only.
