{% raw %}I went today and picked up our check for the last calves we hauled. Did we get a good price? Then from there I decided to have a cheat day and bought me a double meat burger. YUMMMMM!  Dining rooms locking up here again at numerous places.  <br /><br />We are a Fil Am couple sharing our lives between living in Texas USA and Panay Island Philippines. We share dealing with two different cultures, building our solid concrete  cast in place home beach side and exploring/ seeking new things. We hope you enjoy and join to be a apart of a bigger family here on this channel.<br /><br /><br />Thank you for being apart of our channel and lives. <br />James and Melinda<br /><br />jamesray080808@gmail.com{% endraw %}
