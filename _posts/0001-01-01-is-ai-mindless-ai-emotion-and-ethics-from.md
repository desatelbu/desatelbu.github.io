{% raw %}From Berggruen Institute's China Center Seminar Series: Is AI Mindless?<br />AI has encountered Moravec's paradox: teaching computers high-level reasoning is easy and teaching them simple sensorimotor skills is difficult. AI ethics calls for building &quot;responsible intelligent machines&quot; that are empathetic in that they understand the social meaning of human behavior, which requires understanding the meaning of Self-Other-World. But in what sense can AI &quot;evolve&quot; emotions and morality when machines today lack autonomy, self-awareness, and practical reasoning? Can we re-examine the dilemma between machine and human from the perspective of the framework and conflict of ancient Greek drama, especially Oedipus the King?<br /><br />Key Discussions:<br />• How do we resolve Moravec's paradox?<br />• Why do we say AI today is mindless?<br />• In what sense can we talk about the emotions and moral responsibilities of machines?<br />• Is it reasonable to talk about AI emotions and ethics from the perspective of human cognition?<br /><br />For more on this lecture visit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.berggruen.org/events/is-ai-mindless-ai-emotion-and-ethics/">https://www.berggruen.org/events/is-ai-mindless-ai-emotion-and-ethics/</a>{% endraw %}
