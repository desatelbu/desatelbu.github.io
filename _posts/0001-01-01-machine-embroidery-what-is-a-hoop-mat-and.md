Designs in Machine embroidery has a wonderful and affordable solution that will help you hoop with precision.  It's called a Hoop Mat, and I love it!!<br /><br />The hoop mat is made of silicone so it is nice and soft and easy to move and remove by rolling up the hooping mat.  the hoop mat is large enough to use any standard hoop, or even better a snap hoop monster hoop!  <br /><br />What will the hoop mat help you with?  A few things!  First, the mat has a nice, clear grid on it - so that will help you set things straight.  The hoop mat also has a center grid that is thicker than the other lines so you will be able to see the center point exactly.    The hoop mat will keep your hoop from moving around while you are trying to get your item hooped.  That is a big issue with hooping most of the time - keeping the hoop in one place while you apply pressure to hoop properly.   This will make hooping much easier - whether you are doing an in the hoop project, or simply hooping fabric and backing, having the hoop stay in one place is going to help out a lot.  <br /><br />One benefit that I noticed during the video was the rulers down each side of the mat.  Yes, that is going to be helpful for me I am always searching for a ruler to get a quick measurement, and it will be super handy to have it right there on my desk.  Also handy is that this hoop mat is made for embroidery because the measurements on the ruler start from the center out on each side.  Yep, that's for embroidery only - quilters don't measure that way.<br /><br />I think this hoop mat from DIME (designs in machine embroidery) will help with beginner embroidery and advanced embroidery hooping - no matter what machine embroidery project you are working on, the hooping mat is going to help you out.<br /><br />MACHINE EMBROIDERY EDUCATION.
