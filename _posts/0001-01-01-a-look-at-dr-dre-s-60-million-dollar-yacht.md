{% raw %}You’ve gotta check out Dr. Dre’s favorite superyacht-- the lavish Naia, which features everything from inflatable water slides to its very own 5-person submarine. Explore deep below the sea or enjoy an adrenaline filled ride on a jet ski-- the choices are endless aboard the Naia! <br /><br />First built in 2011 and then refitted with extra luxury features in 2014, the yacht has been valued between $60 million and $100 million. It can be chartered weekly for a price of over $600,000! Other toys enjoyed by Dre and the yacht’s rich guests include wakeboards, a trampoline, and mountain bikes for pit stops on land. <br /><br />Inside, the lavish ship is decked out with oak, walnut, and unique sculptures. Dre gets to enjoy a jacuzzi, fitness room, master penthouse with 360-degree ocean views, and plenty of entertainment spaces-- like a ritzy living room with a projector screen. The yacht comes with a gourmet chef and excellent bar staff. In total, it accommodates a crew of 22 to take care of the yacht’s 12 guests. <br /><br />With a networth of $820 million, Dr. Dre can definitely afford such a fancy vessel. The Naia can cruise the seas of the Mediterranean and even the icy waters of the South Pole. At night, the yacht is illuminated in blues and purples, making it look like a lavish city at sea.
