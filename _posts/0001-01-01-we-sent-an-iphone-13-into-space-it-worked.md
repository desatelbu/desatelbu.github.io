{% raw %}Thanks to Epic Games for sponsoring this video! FORTNITEMARES is here! New &amp; returning outfits are in store, the Horde Rush LTM, Wrath of Cube Queen Event &amp; screening of short films for Shortnitemares. Jump into Fortnite now!: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cherrypicktalent.cc/FortnitemaresDangieBros">https://cherrypicktalent.cc/FortnitemaresDangieBros</a><br /><br />We sent an iPhone 13 into outer space! We used a space weather balloon and our specifically designed rig with attached GoPros, GPS, and iPhone 13 to successfully launch and recapture the payload. Will the iPhone work in outer space? Can we FaceTime with space? We had these questions too, but unfortunately the FAA has rules and regulations that don't allow the phone to be on with the payload. We had a lot of problems, but we overcame them and successfully sent our iPhone 13 to space.<br /><br />FOLLOW DANGIE BROS ON OUR SOCIAL MEDIAS (@TheDangieBros):<br /><br />Facebook:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/DangieBrosVideos/">https://www.facebook.com/DangieBrosVideos/</a><br /><br />Instagram:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/thedangiebros/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/thedangiebros/?hl=en</a><br /><br />FOLLOW OUR PERSONAL INSTAGRAMS:<br /><br />Follow Chris on Instagram: (@christopherryan98)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/christopherryan98/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/christopherryan98/?hl=en</a><br /><br />Follow Jeff on Instagram: (@jeffufahh)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/jeffufahh/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/jeffufahh/?hl=en</a>{% endraw %}
