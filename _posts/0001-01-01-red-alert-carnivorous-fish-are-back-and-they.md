Maddyâ€™s mission now is to convince the authorities of an impending attack before the same Lake Victory massacre events repeat itself.<br /><br />Subscribe for more Movie Recaps: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3k3TitI">https://bit.ly/3k3TitI</a><br /><br />Thanks for watching!{% endraw %}
