{% raw %}Jesus Christ is many things to many people. He is easily THE MOST influential figure in human history. His words and actions changed the course and nature of the society in which he lived, as well as the world at large. Today, over 2 billion people name his name as their savior. It is difficult to imagine what the world would have looked like had he not come and shown us all how to love one another. His example sits in the back of all of our minds, whether we realize it or not.<br /><br />In a time where so many of us focus on the evil and wicked things of the world (myself included), where 'wrong' seems to be the new 'right', it is so easy for us to forget why we embarked on this journey to begin with... So let us listen carefully to the powerful words spoken by our Lord Jesus Christ. Words full of Love, Truth, Wisdom and Life. And let us live as beacons of light and hope, in a world full of darkness.<br /><br />Please consider sharing these videos with others.<br /><br />Original footage belonging to:<br />The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints<br /><br />Find me and more of my videos at:<br />Youtube - www.youtube.com/scrawny2brawny<br />Facebook - www.youtube.com/scrawny2brawnyOFFICIAL<br />Back-up channel - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/-eQxHPI86Nw">https://youtu.be/-eQxHPI86Nw</a>{% endraw %}
