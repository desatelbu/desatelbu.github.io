{% raw %}Hey guys! Today we're coming to the aid of our Trojan cousins as Memnon, the Aethiopian King. New mechanics abound as we march our horde across Rhodes, Crete, and beyond! There's some nice quality of life changes coming for free alongside the Rhesus &amp; Memnon DLC that I'm rather happy with, too. I'm sure we'll see plenty of those tweaks as we play. Enjoy!<br /><br />Steam versions of A Total War Saga: TROY and all of it's DLC are available on my store:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.nexus.gg/Janet">https://www.nexus.gg/Janet</a><br /><br />Join the Discord:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/gWVydDQ">https://discord.gg/gWVydDQ</a><br /><br />Follow me on Twitter:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/JanetOnOccasion">https://twitter.com/JanetOnOccasion</a><br /><br />Support the channel on Patreon:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/JanetOnOccasion">https://www.patreon.com/JanetOnOccasion</a><br /><br />Or you can become a member through Youtube:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdbuDbg7DTogK7NYA0UsgrQ/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdbuDbg7DTogK7NYA0UsgrQ/join</a><br /><br />Some of you might prefer to watch my Livestreams on Twitch:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/janetonoccasion">https://www.twitch.tv/janetonoccasion</a><br /><br />For business you can use my email address:<br />JanetOnOccasion@gmail.com<br /><br />Have a good day, guys.<br /><br />The outro music is a excerpt from the cover of &quot;King Of The Rodeo - Kings of Leon&quot; by a fine subscriber of mine that goes by the name of David McMichael.
