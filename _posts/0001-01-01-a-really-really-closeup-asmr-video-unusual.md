{% raw %}I own a really good macro lens that is really good at taking really close-up images of really small things and making them appear really big. I used it to take really close-up video of the really good stereo microphone that’s attached really well to my really good audio recorder. I then used various objects to brush, tap, scratch, scrape, pick, peck and poke really good at, on and around the aforementioned microphone. There is even some really bonus content of really shoving the recorder into a bowl and container that are really full of really different things which really will be its own full length video in the really near future. And that's really it!<br /><br />00:00:00 Really permanent tingles<br />00:02:58 A really different kind of exam<br />00:06:50 Not really preparing for a shave<br />00:08:49 The Vinyl Nameless Red One Who Smiles<br />00:10:40 These matches are really lit!<br />00:13:44 You should really listen to this mixtape!<br />00:16:06 What if it's really not #2 though...<br />00:20:28 It really should be called &quot;Sleep Hour&quot; <br />00:22:34 It really must be Halloween<br />00:23:57 Really Resident Relaxation<br />00:25:25 They're really not just for building<br />00:28:46 Inner Peace via Inner Sleeve.
