Janelle Mon치e<br /><br />Give me a second I,<br />I need to get my story straight<br />My friends are in the bathroom getting higher than the Empire State<br />My lover she's waiting for me just across the bar<br />My seat's been taken by some sunglasses asking bout a scar, and<br />I know I gave it to you months ago<br />I know you're trying to forget<br />But between the drinks and subtle things<br />The holes in my apologies, you know<br />I'm trying hard to take it back<br />So if by the time the bar closes<br />And you feel like falling down<br />I'll carry you home<br /><br />Tonight<br />We are young<br />So let's set the world on fire<br />We can burn brighter than the sun<br /><br />Tonight<br />We are young<br />So let's set the world on fire<br />We can burn brighter than the sun<br /><br />Now I know that I'm not<br />All that you got<br />I guess that I, I just thought<br />Maybe we could find new ways to fall apart<br />But our friends are back<br />So let's raise a glass<br />'Cause I found someone to carry me home<br /><br />Tonight<br />We are young<br />So let's set the world on fire<br />We can burn brighter than the sun<br /><br />Tonight<br />We are young<br />So let's set the world on fire<br />We can burn brighter than the sun<br /><br />Carry me home tonight<br />Just carry me home tonight<br />Carry me home tonight<br />Just carry me home tonight<br /><br />The moon is on my side<br />I have no reason to run<br />So will someone come and carry me home tonight<br />The angels never arrived<br />But I can hear the choir<br />So will someone come and carry me home<br /><br />Tonight<br />We are young<br />So let's set the world on fire<br />We can burn brighter than the sun<br /><br />Tonight<br />We are young<br />So let's set the world on fire<br />We can burn brighter than the sun<br /><br />So if by the time the bar closes<br />And you feel like falling down<br />I'll carry you home tonight<br /><br />- - - - - - - - - - -<br />&quot;If you'd like to submit a video to the channel, please visit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.unitedframes.tv/pricing">https://www.unitedframes.tv/pricing</a><br />Or contact samuel@unitedframes.tv&quot;<br />- - - - - - - - - - - -<br /><br />游닝 Wallpaper: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://unsplash.com">https://unsplash.com</a><br />- - - - - - - - - - - -<br />#WeAreYoung #Fun #DopeLyrics #JanelleMon치e #7Clouds #UniqueVibes #SyrebralVibes #TazNetwork #MrShades #LeaderOfLyrics #SuperbLyrics #Cassiopeia #ShadowMusic #TikTok #SpotifyViral <br />.........<br />Lyric video for &quot;We Are Young&quot; by Fun, Janelle Mon치e.{% endraw %}
