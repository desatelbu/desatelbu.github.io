{% raw %}The lowest frequency of human emotion, shame, robs us of our human dignity and divine self-expression. This live feed explores the deceit of shame about skin color, body, trauma, money, religion, etc and brings into light reconnecting to your divine potential through Creatorâ€™s light and through electromagnetic program and belief activations. This process is intended to help your subconscious in overcoming shame and freeing you to be the great YOU you were born to be.<br />**************************************************<br />Our site is www.yu2shine.com<br />Instagram @Vica_Rader{% endraw %}
