{% raw %}The video is kinda pink indeed. The filmmaking was conducted during the months of July and August of 2021 and they depict various places in Greece. The storytelling of the video, as well as the poem, is a bit abstract because I feel the concept of love and mental health can be accurately depicted the less accurate you try to be. These are my thoughts and some glimpses of my summer, I hope you like it and maybe connect with it. <br /><br />ðŸ”°Support me on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/illneas">https://www.patreon.com/illneas</a><br /><br />ðŸ”°Find me here ðŸ”—<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/_illneas/">https://www.instagram.com/_illneas/</a><br />                            ðŸ”—<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/illneas/">https://www.facebook.com/illneas/</a><br />                            ðŸ”—<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/illneas">https://twitter.com/illneas</a><br /><br />Second channel<br />ðŸ”—<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3urbsMSDr9XmgtnFdWZe_Q">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3urbsMSDr9XmgtnFdWZe_Q</a><br /><br /><br />ðŸ”°Communities <br />-<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/kfxthmS3F4">https://discord.gg/kfxthmS3F4</a><br />-<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/2314655172176122/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/2314655172176122/</a><br />-<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/searchingformeaning/">https://www.reddit.com/r/searchingformeaning/</a><br /><br />ðŸ”°References <br /><br />-The narrator is Iness J.<br />Her email.<br />ðŸ”—ijprojects.side@gmail.com<br /><br />-The music is this: <br />Midtro - Homeland<br /><br />ðŸ”°My equipment: <br />I film handheld with a Panasonic Lumix <br />G80<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2uGqmQZ">https://amzn.to/2uGqmQZ</a><br />GX80<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/33e5Tye">https://amzn.to/33e5Tye</a><br />ðŸ“·Olympus M.Zuiko Digital 45mm F1.8 Lens  <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2vr9P3N">https://amzn.to/2vr9P3N</a><br /><br />ðŸ”°Loving Me When I Can't Love Myself by illneas<br /><br />At first<br />it was the sound of your voice <br />and the way it seemed you were hiding something <br /><br />While you were sleeping I noticed your anxious breathing <br />but I didn't say anything <br />The hardest part of loving them <br />when they can't love themselves<br />Is accepting your inability to always make them happy<br /><br />I know that something is bothering you <br />but I chose to ignore it<br />The hardest part of loving them <br />when they can't love themselves <br />Is letting them find happiness <br />in the absence of you<br /><br />I noticed that each smile seems <br />more forced than the last <br />The hardest part of loving you <br />when you can't love yourself <br />Is convincing you <br />that this is not affecting me<br /><br />You asked me to let you deal with it yourself<br />The hardest part of loving you <br />when you can't love me<br />Is hiding from you <br />that something is bothering me<br /><br />While I was sleeping you noticed my anxious breathing <br />but you didn't say anything <br />You know that something is wrong <br />but you chose to ignore it<br />Each of my smiles seems more forced than the last one <br /><br />The hardest part of loving me <br />when I can't love myself<br />Is knowing that <br />I would do the same for you{% endraw %}
