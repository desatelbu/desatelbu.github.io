{% raw %}When uploading the first series of carriages, there were many people who requested the version of the night carriage. Sorry to those who have been waiting. I thought about the concept of saving a princess in a fantasy world. I use the sound of the carriage and the sound of grass bugs and owls to make it feel like a night forest. The sky is decorated with mysterious lights such as a very large moon and aurora to give a strong fantasy feel. It doesn't matter whether you are a man or a woman. Since you are a professional solver, if you meet bandits on the way, you can lightly suppress them, right?🐱‍👤⚔️🧙<br /><br />Program Used - 3dsmax<br />- Premiere Pro<br />- After effect<br />- lumion<br />- Photoshop<br /><br />My Channel Click - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVlp63hzHZx0dXSz0wT5LAQ?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVlp63hzHZx0dXSz0wT5LAQ?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />○ All videos are from Dreamy Sound.
