{% raw %}MOSCOW — A cargo plane designed to fly just above the ground and capable of carrying up to 500 tons of cargo in a single trip is under development in Russia. <br /><br />Scientists from Russia’s Central AeroHydrodynamic Institute are currently testing models of the Ground Effect Vehicle (GEV), according to a news release on the institute’s website.<br /><br />The aircraft would fly over the ground, water or ice in a range of 3 to 12 meters from the surface.<br /><br />Short, wide wings are designed to trap air between the aircraft and the ground. This creates downdraughts that produce greater lift force and less drag than other fixed wing-aircraft, allowing the plane to carry bigger loads with less fuel.<br /><br />Russia has a tradition of developing low-flying GEVs, also known as “ekranoplan.” <br /><br />The Soviet Union built several of these giant low-flying aircraft in the 1970s and 1980s. <br /><br />Perhaps the best known example was a 544-ton experimental vehicle, which was nicknamed the “Caspian Sea Monster” by Western intelligence and was the largest aircraft in the world when it was built in 1966.<br /><br />----------------------------------------­---------------------<br /><br />Go to <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/tomonews">https://www.patreon.com/tomonews</a> and become a Patron now <br /><br />TomoNews is now on Patreon and we've got some cool perks for our hardcore fans.<br /><br />TomoNews is your best source for real news.
