After completing her prison sentence last year, the famed dance instructor was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. But if anything, Abby has proven she is a fighter and is not ready to hang up the dance shoes. The new season of Dance Moms follows Abby as she rebuilds her dance company while battling the after-effects of cancer that has left her confined to a wheelchair. Abby is ready to get back to her life and do what she loves most...teaching students to dance! With the goal of putting her life, health and dance studio back together, Abby returns to where it all began - the Abby Lee Dance Company in Pittsburgh.<br /><br />Dance Moms follows children's early steps on the road to stardom along with their doting mothers all under Abby Lee Miller's discerning eyes. Presenting a powerful cast of characters, the show immerses itself in the highs and lows surrounding dance competition season, delivering a captivating and dramatic look at the cast's intense pursuit of National Dance titles. Centered on the devoted Miller, who runs Abby Lee Dance Company with an iron tap shoe as she instructs her young, talented students while also dealing with impassioned mothers who go to great lengths to help their children's dreams come true, Dance Moms is about what really goes on behind-the-scenes in the fast-growing and controversial sport of competitive dance.{% endraw %}
