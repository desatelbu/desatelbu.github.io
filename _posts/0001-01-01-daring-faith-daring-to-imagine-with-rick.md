One of God’s greatest gifts is the tool of imagination. In fact, God saw beforehand everything we see or do. Nothing in this world becomes reality without someone having pictured it first. Albert Einstein, Walt Disney and George Lucas had some of the most creative minds of the last century. In this message, Pastor Rick Warren shares eight tools to unlock your imagination. God wants you to dream big and he smiles when you’re being creative. Pursuing the dreams God has for you takes Daring Faith. Learn about how your daring faith can help you pursue the big dreams God has for your life. <br /><br /><br />Learn about Daring Faith in community.
