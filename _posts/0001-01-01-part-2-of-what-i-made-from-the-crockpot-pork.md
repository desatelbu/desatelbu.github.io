{% raw %}So I fixed a pork tenderloin in the crockpot and made barbecue with half of it. Today I used the other half and made soup. I thought both were very good. Thank you so much for watching. I always appreciate it!   🤗<br /><br />For snail mail correspondence:<br />Jan Creson <br />2045 Adare Court <br />Newton,NC 28658<br /><br />❤️🤗{% endraw %}
