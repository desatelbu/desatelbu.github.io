{% raw %}Vladimir Putin is the Russian president-- and he also happens to be a multi billionaire.  He’s a man that reportedly has a life of luxury that most of us could only ever dream of-- except he makes certain that he keeps an image of a working man!  But when you take into account that he either owns, or has access to,  upwards of 20 villas, 58 private planes, and to our knowledge 4 luxury yachts-- which we are going to talk about in today’s video, it’s hard to think of him as anything but one of The Richest.  So, let’s get down to it.   Just how much is he worth?  Potentially 70 billion dollars… or more.  But, we can’t say for sure because honestly, we don’t know!  So, if Vladimir Putin has a net worth of around $70 billion dollars at the time of writing this video, then... with that kind of cash... you can bet that those yachts we were talking about are truly some of the most spectacular ever constructed..  It’s time to take a look at his sea-faring toys.  Whether he’s trekking out on The Graceful, The Olympia, or maybe he’s sailing on The Seagull, Putin relaxes in style.  Today, we want to check out his absolutely bonkers yacht collection.  Which consists of at least FOUR yachts.  It’s time to take a peek inside the incredible lifestyle of Mr. Vladimir Putin, and imagine just what it must be like to be able to hop between, not two, not three… but FOUR luxury yachts.  Sigh.  Must be nice.<br /><br />Subscribe for more amazing videos! ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Richest">http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Richest</a> ◄<br /><br /><br />Written by: Chris Montrose<br />Narrated by: Chris Montrose<br />Edited by: Adam A. <br /><br />For copyright matters please contact us at: legal@valnetinc.com<br /><br />CHAPTERS:<br /><br />0:00 Intro<br />00:34 The Olympia<br />2:34 The Graceful<br />4:16 The CHAYKA (The Seagull)<br />6:12 The Petrel<br />7:06 Does he own this one too?{% endraw %}
