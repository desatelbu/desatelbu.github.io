{% raw %}October 31, 2021<br /><br />On this episode of What's Going on With Shipping, host Sal Mercogliano - Chair of the Department of History, Criminal Justice, and Political Science, former merchant mariner, and instructor of Maritime History, Security and Industry Policy - discusses the Shipping Crisis from the deck plates of a ship, and the perspective an American merchant mariner.  We use a video recently posted by Bryan Boyle on board Maersk Seletar (I erred in thinking he was on Maersk Pittsburgh, but the ships are on similar services) to talk about issues facing the ships and mariners.  We also talk about some reforms that the United States should be enacting to facilitate the movement of cargo between US ports and short seas shipping. <br /><br />#shippingcrisis #supplychain #containerships #ports #logistics #shortseashipping #containers #merchantmarine #shipping #shippingindustry <br /><br />00:00 Intro<br />00:49 Bryan Boyle in Savannah<br />12:21 Maritime Security Program <br /><br />Current Shipping Delays With Cargo Ships<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/EVEPhAjjiSE">https://youtu.be/EVEPhAjjiSE</a><br /><br />Maersk Pittsburgh - Marine Traffic <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:393407/mmsi:338071000/imo:9342176/vessel:MAERSK_PITTSBURGH">https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:393407/mmsi:338071000/imo:9342176/vessel:MAERSK_PITTSBURGH</a><br /><br />Maersk Pittsburgh Schedule<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.maersk.com/schedules/vesselSchedules?vesselCode=Q4A&amp;fromDate=2021-10-01">https://www.maersk.com/schedules/vesselSchedules?vesselCode=Q4A&amp;fromDate=2021-10-01</a><br /><br />Maersk MECL1 Westbound Route<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.maersk.com/local-information/shipping-from-west-central-asia-to-north-america/mecl1-westbound">https://www.maersk.com/local-information/shipping-from-west-central-asia-to-north-america/mecl1-westbound</a><br /><br />Maersk MECL1 Eastbound Route<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.maersk.com/local-information/shipping-from-north-america-to-west-central-asia/mecl1-eastbound">https://www.maersk.com/local-information/shipping-from-north-america-to-west-central-asia/mecl1-eastbound</a><br /><br />The McCown Report - Top 10 US Ports for September 2021<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/september-inbound-boxes-up-16-outbound-down-138-john-d-mccown/">https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/september-inbound-boxes-up-16-outbound-down-138-john-d-mccown/</a><br /><br />Maritime Security Program <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.maritime.dot.gov/national-security/strategic-sealift/maritime-security-program-msp">https://www.maritime.dot.gov/national-security/strategic-sealift/maritime-security-program-msp</a><br /><br />Biden nominates climate expert to lead Maritime Administration<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.freightwaves.com/news/biden-nominates-climate-expert-to-lead-maritime-administration">https://www.freightwaves.com/news/biden-nominates-climate-expert-to-lead-maritime-administration</a>{% endraw %}
