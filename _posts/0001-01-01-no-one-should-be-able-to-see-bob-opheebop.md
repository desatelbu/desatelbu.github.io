{% raw %}Ron from the popular rhythm video game Friday Night Funkin uncovers a conspiracy about how you shouldn't even be able to see Bob Opheebop and Little man on certain backgrounds. I mean technically Ron is wrong because the outside of their figure is highlighted with a black line, but let's just give Ron this one. <br /><br />Lately it's been hard for me to figure out any good animations  idea's related to Bob and friend's, i'm thinking of making more sequels to previous Ron videos, such as cooking with Ron 6, assassinating with Ron 2 and even a sequel to a old animation that not many of you may remember. Even though its become increasingly harder to pump out high quality videos at the rate I do, it's always worth it to see that it makes people happy!<br /><br />Huge thanks to anyone who re-animates my stuff, it's always a pleasure to see what you guys have made for me, and it always warms my heart seeing getting inspired by me, thanks for the support!<br /><br />Bob mod: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/285296">https://gamebanana.com/mods/285296</a><br /><br />#fnf #animation #meme{% endraw %}
