Katie, 34, and John, 41, from Florida, first met on Plenty of Fish, and at the time, thought of themselves as conventional when it came to relationships. But then, a drunken threesome with a friend changed everything. Not only did it help Katie realise that she was bisexual, but the couple were both struck by how &quot;right&quot; it felt to sleep with other people. Realising they weren't as monogamous as they thought, Katie and John began doing research and eventually discovered swinging. It took a year - and several ground rules to work through early jealousy issues - before they did a full couple swap, but they have not looked back since then. Though they receive a lot of negativity on social media, where they openly post about their lifestyle in a bid to normalise non-monogamy and dispel common misconceptions, they have no regrets. OnlyFans model Katie said: &quot;Swinging has definitely brought us closer as a couple.&quot; <br /><br />Follow Katie:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/katielin_nextdoorls/">https://www.instagram.com/katielin_nextdoorls/</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/onlyswing_katielin/">https://www.instagram.com/onlyswing_katielin/</a><br /><br />Follow Naomi:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/therealnaomifox/">https://www.instagram.com/therealnaomifox/</a><br /><br />Follow Peter:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/peter_fitzwell14/">https://www.instagram.com/peter_fitzwell14/</a><br /><br />Videographer: Gerrit Messersmith<br />Producers: Erin Cardiff &amp; Ruby Coote<br />Editor: Alex Lubetkin<br /><br />Truly is on TikTok! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show">https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show</a><br /><br />Now you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES">http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES</a><br /><br />Click here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! <br />Truly - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow">https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow</a><br />Born Different - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/">https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/</a><br />Shake My Beauty - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/">https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/</a><br />Hooked On The Look - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/">https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/</a><br />Love Don't Judge - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/">https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/</a><br />Beastly - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/">https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/</a><br />Ridiculous Rides - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/">https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/</a><br />Dog Dynasty - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/">https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/</a><br /><br />For more amazing content, click here!<br />Beastly: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA</a><br />Barcroft Cars: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured">https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured</a>{% endraw %}
