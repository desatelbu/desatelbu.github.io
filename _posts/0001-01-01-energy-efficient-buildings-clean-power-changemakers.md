{% raw %}Energy Efficient Buildings | Clean Power | Changemakers | Business Documentary from 2009<br /><br />In this episode we look at the home of the future. A gizmo that generates clean power within<br />your house; a skyscraper combo-glass that insulates from the tropical heat, is self-cleaning – and<br />actually generates electricity for the building from the sunlight that falls on it; and the professors in Taiwan busy pulling down walls and digging up concrete, making a start on turning the ultra-urban Taipei into a haven for streams and wild plants.<br /><br />Changemakers<br />Had enough of eco-doom and gloom? Taking swimming lessons to cope with the rising sea-levels after climate change? This series looks at some of the weirdest climate change projects emerging from Asia. With its ever-increasing emissions comes the huge threat of climate change.<br />But Changemakers won’t take no for an answer. They’ve been told that Asia is the problem, with its ever-increasing emissions – but they also know that Asia, with its boundless energy and creativity, can come up with the solutions, too. Scientists and activists across all fields of science and technology are coming up with ideas large and small that all make a difference – and can help inspire others the world over.<br />▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬<br />Subscribe ENDEVR for free: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3e9YRRG">https://bit.ly/3e9YRRG</a><br />Join the club and become a Patron: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/freedocumentary">https://www.patreon.com/freedocumentary</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG">https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2QlwRiI">https://bit.ly/2QlwRiI</a><br />▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬<br />#FreeDocumentary #ENDEVR #Biofuels<br />▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬<br />ENDEVR explains the world we live in through high-class documentaries, special investigations, explainers videos and animations.
