{% raw %}I'M GIVING AWAY A FREE IPHONE 13!<br /><br />Recently on my trip to New York I went to a random gas station and bought $190 worth of Pokémon cards. But in my last video I open the half the packs with @Ryan Prunty and with Only half the packs Bing left I had to do the rest￼￼ with @Stove's Kitchen ! This turned in to one of the craziest card opening videos I’ve ever done and you’ll find out why very soon! Please don’t forget to hit that subscribe button and like the video for a chance to win a free iPhone￼ 13!￼{% endraw %}
