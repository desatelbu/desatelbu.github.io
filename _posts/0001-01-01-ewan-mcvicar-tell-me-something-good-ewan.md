{% raw %}Ewan McVicar - Tell Me Something Good <br /><br />Available here - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://lnk.to/TRICK031">https://lnk.to/TRICK031</a><br />‘Tell Me Something Good’ sees the Scottish DJ/producer cover Rufus &amp; Chaka Khan’s 70s jam of the same name, twisting catchy vocals and huge synth stabs into an ecstatic peak time club weapon. ‘Delta’ brings the tempo down, but keeps the energy levels high as piano chords drift effortlessly across a chugging breakbeat and rolling basslines, making for a feel-good closing track to another standout release from Trick.{% endraw %}
