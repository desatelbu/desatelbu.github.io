{% raw %}This is your commentator, fresh from the Booster Shot, let's stop validating the morons who are collaborating with Covid-19 to keep the ICUs full and the health care workers at risk. They aren't &quot;waiting for more information&quot; - they're AFRAID. They aren't &quot;exercising personal choice&quot; - they're AFRAID.<br /><br />AFRAID of things they're dumb to understand.<br />AFRAID of doing anything anybody else tells them.<br />AFRAID of having been wrong about this whole thing.<br />AFRAID of NEEDLES.{% endraw %}
