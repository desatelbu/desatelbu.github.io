{% raw %}George started a dance group to help his friends stay out of trouble. But he found more than just a dance group — he found a community, a home.<br /><br />&quot;It's really a family to us. We try to help where we can, because you find, like, someone doesn't have food in his house. We'll just sit down and forget about dancing. You contribute together — you give that person something to eat for that night, and maybe two or three days.&quot;<br /><br />For more #GrottoStories subscribe to our YouTube channel here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://youtube.com/grottonetwork?sub_confirmation=1">http://youtube.com/grottonetwork?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />Connect with us on social media!<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/GrottoNetwork/">https://www.instagram.com/GrottoNetwork/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/GrottoNetwork">https://twitter.com/GrottoNetwork</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/GrottoNetwork/">https://www.facebook.com/GrottoNetwork/</a><br />Pinterest: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pinterest.com/GrottoNetwork/">https://www.pinterest.com/GrottoNetwork/</a><br /><br />Visit us at grottonetwork.com/<br /><br />Subscribe to our weekly newsletter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2Dlzud7">http://bit.ly/2Dlzud7</a>{% endraw %}
