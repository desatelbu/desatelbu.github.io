{% raw %}20 years ago I lost 30kgs. Most people think that losing weight was the hardest part of my weight loss journey. But as I look back at my BIGGEST learnings from keeping off 30kgs for 20 years I realise that losing weight is just the beginning. Today I am sharing 8 insights to achieve lasting weight loss, because everybody is talking about how to lose weight but not many people know what makes weight loss last so you can keep the weight off for good.<br /><br />After Jeff's own weight loss transformation he went on to help many others achieve long term weight loss for themselves. Jeff is a qualified Personal Trainer, Weight Loss Coach and Hypnotherapist so he can share qualified technical and emotional support to guide people struggling with maintaining their weight loss.<br /><br />The truth is that everybody's weight loss journey is different. What works for some people's lifestyle is not healthy or sustainable for others. What works for you needs to be developed by you. <br /><br />With these 8 insights derived from Jeff's personal before and after weight loss journey, you will realise how you can lose weight and maintain it for the long term, not reverting on and off to the same diet and workout plan that no longer works for you.<br /><br />*****<br />DON'T FORGET TO SUBSCRIBE AND HIT THE NOTIFICATIONS BELL TO KEEP UP TO DATE WITH OUR WEEKLY VIDEOS<br /><br />0:00​ INTRO<br />1:15​ 1.
