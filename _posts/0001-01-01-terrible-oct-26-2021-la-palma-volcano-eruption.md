Scientists say the eruption could go on for three months.<br /><br />Although most of the island of 85,000 people off north-west Africa is unaffected by the eruption, part of the western side has seen the lava ruin livelihoods and destroy homes. The molten rock has covered more than 866 hectares and crushed or damaged around 2,185 buildings.<br /><br />#Lapalma #Volcano #IGME #ING #Cumbrevieja #Spain #Canaryisland #VOA #THESUN #DW #TVE #Guardiacivil #Globalnews #Skynews{% endraw %}
