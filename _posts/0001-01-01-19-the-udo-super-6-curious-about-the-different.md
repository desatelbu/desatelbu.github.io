{% raw %}Here is part two of a two-part demonstration of the Voice Assign functionality found on the UDO Super 6.  <br /><br />The theme for this demonstration was recorded by multitracking the UDO Super 6 in order to provide the various parts necessary.  No external equalization or effects were used.  The drums were created through programming the Korg Triton LE and processing the results through the Landscape Stereo Field. <br /><br />This video was funded by the Patreon supporters of Automatic Gainsay.
