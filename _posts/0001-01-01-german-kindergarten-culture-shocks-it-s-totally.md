{% raw %}When we moved to Germany, we thought starting German kindergarten for our then four-year-old daughter would be easy and fun. But we actually ended up having to make some big cultural and mindset adjustments to so we could all thrive.

What we are finding is that we really love it and think there is a lot that Americans could learn from Germany's philosophy on raising kids!<br /><br />ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª VIDEOS MENTIONED IN THIS VIDEO ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª<br />+ Why German Playgrounds are AWESOME and Our American Kids Love Them! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-lgX73MILs&amp;t=646s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-lgX73MILs&amp;t=646s</a><br />+ What German School is Like for Our American Kids - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJxD0uLOS4s&amp;t=763s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJxD0uLOS4s&amp;t=763s</a><br />+ German Childhood + Self Reliance - Are German Kids More Independent than in America? <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G94acDDpBQ8&amp;t=423s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G94acDDpBQ8&amp;t=423s</a><br />+ German Childhood Part 2 - What Germans Say a Self Reliant Childhood Looks Like! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XltfLKQoeM&amp;t=743s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XltfLKQoeM&amp;t=743s</a><br />â€‹+  @Black Forest Family  - THINGS THAT MAKE SENSE IN GERMAN KITA, that Seem Odd in American Daycare -  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ytl14lxq9Pg&amp;t=20s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ytl14lxq9Pg&amp;t=20s</a><br /><br />ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª See our Raising Kids in Germany playlist here - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMUy6rPvNf97Cn8enlrCvxJER3nrRMmPd">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMUy6rPvNf97Cn8enlrCvxJER3nrRMmPd</a><br /><br />ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª See all of our Life in Germany blog posts and videos here - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mymerrymessylife.com/category/family/travel-and-life-in-germany/">https://mymerrymessylife.com/category/family/travel-and-life-in-germany/</a><br /><br />ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª See our Life in Germany YouTube playlist here - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMUy6rPvNf96RmlBl22TCRUbrY3rTdPtb">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMUy6rPvNf96RmlBl22TCRUbrY3rTdPtb</a><br /><br />ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ªSee our Traveling with Kids playlist here - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMUy6rPvNf96Ml8PvPznoX6r61eVtSgoV">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMUy6rPvNf96Ml8PvPznoX6r61eVtSgoV</a><br /><br />//ABOUT US//<br />We are a family of six, with four kids and a cat ðŸ˜¹, who moved from the USA to Germany in February of 2021 to pursue our dreams of adventure, travel, learning another language, and integrating into German life.
