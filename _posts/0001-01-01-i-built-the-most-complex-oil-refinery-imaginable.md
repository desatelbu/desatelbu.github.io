Pioneering for FICSIT Incorporated means charting and exploiting an alien planet, battling alien lifeforms, creating multi-story factories, entering conveyor belt heaven, automating vehicles, and researching new technologies. The Satisfactory Train update and Nuclear update also adds in trains, train stations, and nuclear power plant to enjoy, if you can handle the nuclear waste that is! In some of our videos, we go over Satisfactory tips and Satisfactory building tips, as well how to build a mega base and manufacturer setup. Our Satisfactory Early Access letâ€™s play ep 1 was started a few months ago, but now we have hundreds of hours since Satisfactory ep 1 and have built a giant base with computer production, supercomputer production, a huge nuclear power plant and hundreds of trains! Our giant train system covers the entire map and gathers uranium, deals with our nuclear waste, and Satisfactory trains are a very satisfactory way of travel!<br />Satisfactory Update 3 also changed the game entirely adding pipes, Hyper Tubes, the Awesome Shop and Awesome Sink (aka Resource Sink), a new desert biome, a new vehicle, and a ton more! Recently though Satisfactory Update 4 released adding in the very Satisfactory Tier 8 with: plutonium, plutonium waste, a hover pack, the blender, a battery building, ziplines, gas, reservoirs and wells, drones, new space elevator parts, and a whole lot more too!<br />Zufriedenstellend lass uns das Gameplay spielen im neuen Update!<br />Satisfactory Update 5 then added in a ton of quality of life features like zooping, train collisions, train signals, and a ton more.<br />Satisfactory is an FPS open-world factory building sim by CoffeeStain Studios. You play as an engineer on an alien planet as part of the â€˜Save The Dayâ€™ program - a program whose goal is to construct a massive machine for a mysterious purpose. Conquer nature, build multi-story factories, and automate to satisfaction!<br />Follow my Satisfactory Early Access Gameplay for the best base building, best Satisfactory tips, and more!<br /><br />#ImKibitz #Satisfactory #SatisfactoryEarlyAccess{% endraw %}
