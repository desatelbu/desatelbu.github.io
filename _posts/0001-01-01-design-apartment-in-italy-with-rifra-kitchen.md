{% raw %}A project characterized by a contemporary dynamism, whose owners, a young couple, have contacted RiFRA with a precise idea: a design and timeless house. <br /><br />It is a two-level house, the first level where the residential part is developed, while the second level is on the terrace of the building that hosts the home and is dedicated to the wellness area and includes the solarium, an outdoor swimming pool and a mini-pool with Jacuzzi. <br /><br />The apartment, at the request of the owners, was designed by RiFRALAB, RiFRA's in-house design studio. The tones of the house are developed in three colors: black, white and dove grey. <br /><br />The floor was made of black resin, with strips of LED lights inserted to delimit the area of the iron staircase leading to the terrace, while the tones of dove grey and white are developed on the vertical walls and ceiling. <br /><br />The kitchen chosen is the kitchen model ONE of RiFRA, in white matte lacquer finish. <br /><br />If you are in the process of renovation or you have purchased a house, then request the online consulting service for the design of your new kitchen, you can meet with one of our designers from whom you will receive advice and then you will receive a customized 3D project. <br />Request your free consultation by clicking here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://landing.rifra.com/prog-multi">https://landing.rifra.com/prog-multi</a> <br /><br />---------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Subscribe to this channel to stay up to date on RiFRA's world of Kitchens and Baths. <br /><br />Subscribe to the Newsletter and don't miss our quality content:: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://rifra.com/en/newsletter.aspx">http://rifra.com/en/newsletter.aspx</a><br /><br />Visit the website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.rifra.com">http://www.rifra.com</a>   <br /><br />Like our Facebook page: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/RifraMilano">https://www.facebook.com/RifraMilano</a>   <br /><br />Visit our blog: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://blog.rifra.com/en/">https://blog.rifra.com/en/</a> <br /><br />Follow us on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/riframilano/">https://www.instagram.com/riframilano/</a>{% endraw %}
