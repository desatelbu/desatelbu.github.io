{% raw %}Radhi and Jay Shetty sit down to talk about a very special project they have been working on together for the past 18 months, their ‘quarantine baby’ - Sama Tea! In Sanskrit, Sama means to be fully balanced. It can also mean togetherness, equality, and oneness. Because, ultimately, a life in the present is a more balanced life, a more connected life, and a happier one too. <br /><br />Together they share how Sama was conceptualized, the different teams that worked together to help create the brand, the potions and ingredients that went through several stages and taste-testing to find the best blends, and how Sama is made to help anyone live in the moment and in-tune with their surroundings.<br /><br />Go to <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://samatea.com/onpurpose">http://samatea.com/onpurpose</a> to get on the list for early access + receive a free 5-Minute Wellness Journal made to help guide you through your wellness journey and daily routine<br /><br />What We Discuss In This Episode:<br /><br />00:00 Intro<br />03:30 What is Sama tea?<br />05:15 What Sama means in different languages<br />08:06 Having tea together has that comforting feeling<br />13:17 What we learned about each other while working together<br />20:07 The people who helped make Sama happen<br />24:41 How the branding evolved before launch<br />29:42 Be okay with pivoting, it’s just part of the journey<br />32:25 Infusing adaptogens in Sama teas   <br />41:28 Balance between sharing something from your heart and selling a product <br />44:52 Do three things: something you love, something you learn, something you’re launching<br />46:39 A tea off!<br />47:40 Radhi and Jay on Final Five<br /><br />Like this show?
