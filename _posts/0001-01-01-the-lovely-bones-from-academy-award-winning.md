{% raw %}From Academy Award winning director Peter Jackson comes the extraordinary story about one girl's life, and everything that came after.  When 14-year-old Susie Salmon was murdered, she left her unfinished life behind.  But now from her place in a strange but beautiful in-between world, she must help her father catch her killer and protect her family before she can finally move on.  Filled with thrilling suspense, hope and the redeeming power of love, it's &quot;One of the best films of the year.  Incredibly powerful.&quot; -- Harry Knowles, Ain't it Cool News{% endraw %}
