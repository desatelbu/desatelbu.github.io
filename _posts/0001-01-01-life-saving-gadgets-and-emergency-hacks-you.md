{% raw %}Emergency hacks for all occasions<br /><br /><br /><br />Hello everyone! Today we wanted to share some essential survival tips and hacks that one day may save your life (or at least help you feel comfortable in some situations). <br /><br />First of all, we will show you a bunch of useful emergency hacks for parents. For example, if your kids get a slight injury while playing at the playground, you can use a tampon to stop the blood. If it happens at home, you can freeze a pack of marshmallows or other snacks and use it to reduce the bruise. <br /><br />When you wear new shoes, usually, after a couple of hours, you can't even take a step cause your feet are hurting. Prevent blisters on your feet with bra pads. With them, you won't experience any shoes rubbing anymore ;) <br /><br />If you saw a splinter under your skin, you can easily remove it with this clever hack. First, cover the splinter and skin around it with a liquid black mask. Let it dry, and then you can easily take it out! Another simple way to solve this problem is to use a syringe!<br /><br /><br /><br />TIMESTAMPS:<br /><br />00:22 - First aid hacks for parents<br /><br />01:53 - How to fix a broken nail<br /><br />02:43 - Hack for new shoes<br /><br />03:27 - When your kid has a cold<br /><br /><br />This video is made for entertainment purposes.
