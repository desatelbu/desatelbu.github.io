{% raw %}Originally from the Isle of Man, Tom Mazzone is now based in Cheshire and rides for the St Piran UCI Continental team. In this video Tom - who's raced raced for the Isle of Man at the Commonwealth Games and for St Piran at the Tour of Britain - talks about how he got into road cycling via BMX racing, his three seasons spent racing in Belgium, why he returned to the UK and how working jobs on the side and being helped by personal sponsors has allowed him to dedicate the time needed to training and racing. He also shows us some of the stunning Peak District roads to which he and his younger brother Leon - a fellow St Piran rider - take to on their Lapierre Aircode DRS road bikes.<br /><br />In association with Lapierre: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.lapierrebikes.com/gb-en/">https://www.lapierrebikes.com/gb-en/</a><br /><br />Subscribe to Cycling Weekly here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/CyclingWeekly1?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/user/CyclingWeekly1?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />More at:<br />Cycling Weekly: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.cyclingweekly.com">http://www.cyclingweekly.com</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/CyclingWeekly">https://www.facebook.com/CyclingWeekly</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/cyclingweeklymagazine">https://instagram.com/cyclingweeklymagazine</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/cyclingweekly">http://twitter.com/cyclingweekly</a><br />Email: cycling@futurenet.com<br /><br />DVWAFKBSMRMHNPH5<br />YLQSFGBEZ59AFN81<br />TPTECMNY52SMHLQR<br />CPJ0QNBBRCBQAFW9<br />IC2YNHFLB3ABRFTU{% endraw %}
