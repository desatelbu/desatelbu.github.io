{% raw %}Halloween decorating can be fun and unique whilst using vintage and antiques found at Goodwill, thrift stores, estate sales and auctions! My husband and I live in a Victorian house and I love to decorate in a whimsical Victorian Gothic style for the holiday. The rest of the year, you'll find me thrifting for romantic French and shabby antiques haha.<br /><br />For emails and collaborations: Contact Selena at hellovintagebombshell@gmail.com  <br /><br />Shop my online store The Vintage Bombshell here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thevintagebombshell.com/">https://www.thevintagebombshell.com/</a><br /><br />Shop my creepy giant eyeball orbs from Grandin Road here : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.grandinroad.com/eyeball-orbs-2c-set-of-eight/808247">https://www.grandinroad.com/eyeball-orbs-2c-set-of-eight/808247</a><br /><br />#halloweenhometour #vintagehalloween #victorianhalloween{% endraw %}
