{% raw %}About 9 months ago I decided to buy the Remarkable 2 as a distraction free note taking device and eReader. Since I also own a large iPad Pro I had the chance to compare the Remarkable 2 and the iPad Pro to see which use cases I have for each of them. Spoiler alert: you can't really compare the two.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://remarkable.com">https://remarkable.com</a><br /><br />📸 Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/jaspermeurs">https://instagram.com/jaspermeurs</a><br />💬 Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Jasper_Meurs">https://twitter.com/Jasper_Meurs</a><br />👨🏻‍💻 My website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.jaspermeurs.com">https://www.jaspermeurs.com</a><br /><br />⏱ Video timestamps:<br />0:00 Intro<br />0:28 Remarkable 2 vs iPad<br />0:40 How I use the Remarkable 2<br />2:19 Distraction free<br />3:06 The e-ink display<br />4:10 Battery life<br />4:31 What about updates<br />5:00 What can be improved<br /><br />Who I am:<br />My name is Jasper, I'm an entrepreneur and marketing consultant. When I am not working on my business I love to play with the latest tech, travel to new places (or NYC, which is always a great idea), hone my camera skills in photography and videography or wander through an art museum.<br /><br />But more than the things I do or have done, I’m a person. I have a deep sense of empathy and I enjoy connecting with people; that’s why I do what I do. I’m also a guest lecturer in B2B marketing and Digital Marketing at my alma mater. I thrive on the balance of giving back to those around me, just as much as I enjoy touring the wines of Saint-Émilion.<br /><br />In my videos I share the things I learn and experience on this journey of becoming a better entrepreneur, marketer or just a better person. <br /><br />What Gear Do I Use?<br />Most of my videos are shot with a Sony a7iii. Sometimes I also use my iPhone 13 Pro, Canon 70D, Canon G7X or GoPro Hero 9.{% endraw %}
