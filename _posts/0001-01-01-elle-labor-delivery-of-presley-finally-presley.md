{% raw %}Finally! Presley's amazing 27 hour labor and delivery-- my water breaking, induced with pitocin, debating over epidural and lots of pushing!! She was worth it. =)  Subscribe! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/sub2moms">http://bit.ly/sub2moms</a><br /><br />Please note that everyone has a different labor &amp; delivery experience (ie., my mom had 3 natural childbirths, wow!) What I learned from mine... <br /><br />- Once you are hooked up to I.V., it's so much harder to move and get into a comfortable position (like we practiced in class). <br />- I'm hoping that Pitocin really does give your contractions an &quot;edge&quot;-- otherwise, I'm a total and complete wimp. <br />- One of the hardest parts is not eating-- lollipops saved me! <br />- Pushing was difficult because I literally couldn't feel anything.  This could be why I had a longer recovery, because my body wasn't able to give me feedback. <br />- Filming provides a GREAT distraction. =) <br /><br />Let me know if you have any tips!! xx Elle{% endraw %}
