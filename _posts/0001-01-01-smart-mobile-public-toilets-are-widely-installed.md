To me, it’s a great experience.&quot; Said Hu Li, Resident in Chengdu, Sichuan Province.<br /><br />There's much more to the booth than being just a public toilet in a busy business district, because it also offers power bank rentals, drinks from a vending machine, and temporary lockers.<br /><br />A total of 50 units of such kind of booth called &quot;Easy Station&quot; have been installed across the high-tech District of Chengdu city. Industry insiders say the demand for the kind of smart lavatories are rising sharply in and beyond the city because of its movable and intelligent technology.<br /><br />Up to now, operators say the number of public lavatories per square kilometer is only 4.3 in the district, a figure falling short to the goal of 6.25 per square kilometers, which was set in the nation's plan for the next several years.<br /><br />&quot;In a mega-city like Chengdu, the number of lavatories comes short of the national standard. We establishes them at populated areas such as thoroughfares, green land and amusement parks in our city. In times of the COVID-19 epidemic, we added some new features such as face scanning and temperature checking,&quot; said Niu Bo, Deputy Chief, Ecological Environment and Urban Management Bureau of High-tech Area, Chengdu City.<br /><br />Niu said that those public lavatories converted the ecological value to the economic one, as they put in place the profitable products such as the billboards, the shared power banks and unmanned retail machines. These features reduce the government spending, making the smart toilet a sustainable model.<br /><br />智能版公共廁所已在四川省成都市安裝，為整個行業開啟了改善國內外衛生現狀的新可能。<br /><br />成都某條主幹道附近的地鐵口外設立了一個智能廁所，它以智能技術為動力，與市中心完美契合。<br /><br />“這在我們的日常生活和工作中並不常見，我剛進去，它與傳統的廁所不同，它既不髒也不臭。對我來說，這是一次很棒的體驗。”四川成都人胡麗說。<br /><br />展位不僅僅是繁忙商業區的公共廁所，因為它還提供移動電源租賃、自動售貨機飲料和臨時儲物櫃。<br /><br />成都市高新區共設置了50個這種名為“易站”的展位。業內人士表示，由於其移動和智能技術，對這種智能廁所的需求在城市內外急劇上升。<br /><br />運營商表示，截至目前，該區每平方公里公共廁所數量僅為4.3個，與國家未來幾年規劃中製定的每平方公里6.25個公廁的目標相差甚遠。<br /><br />“在成都這樣的特大城市，廁所數量達不到國家標準。我們在城市的街道、綠地和遊樂園等人口稠密的地區建立它們。在 新冠 流行期間，我們添加了一些新功能，例如面部掃描和體溫檢查，”成都市高新區生態環境與城管局副局長牛波說。<br /><br />牛先生表示，這些公共廁所將生態價值轉化為經濟價值，因為他們安裝了廣告牌、共享移動電源和無人零售機等盈利產品。這些功能減少了政府開支，使智能馬桶成為一種可持續模式。{% endraw %}
