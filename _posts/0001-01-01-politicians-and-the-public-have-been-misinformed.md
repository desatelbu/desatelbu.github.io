{% raw %}Minister for Regional Health Dr David Gillespie says the reason he has been promoting and educating the public on nuclear energy is because politicians and the broader community have been “misinformed about the capabilities”. <br /><br />It comes as a recent Newspoll has revealed public support for nuclear power. <br /><br />“I see it's got a great future but the ban, the legislative ban, is a bipartisan issue,” Mr Gillespie told Sky News host Chris Kenny. <br /><br />“I can tell you there are many more people in the opposition that are like minded but they are keeping their powder dry because it’s obviously an issue within their party. <br /><br />“My job is trying to convince people in parliament that this is not the political issue that they think it will become.”{% endraw %}
