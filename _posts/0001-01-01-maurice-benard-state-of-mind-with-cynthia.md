{% raw %}This weekâ€™s episode I'm joined by Cynthia Watros. You may recognize Cynthia Watros best from her roles as Erin Fitzpatrick on Titus, Kellie on The Drew Carey Show and Libby Smith on Lost.<br /><br />However, Cynthia started her carrier Annie Dutton on Guiding Light, which earned her the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series in 1998; and has had many other guest starring appearances in primetime on shows such as Desperate Housewives, Grey's Anatomy, The Closer, Criminal Minds, House, Hawaii Five-0 and more before joining General Hospital in the role of Nina Reeves in 2019.<br /><br />Cynthia talks to me about growing up in Michigan and the realization of wanting to be an actress.  How she took the role on Guiding Light and what it was like to join Lost in its second season. She candidly opens up to me about a DUI along with the mental health disorders in her family and how she's helping her daughters to navigate that.<br /><br />--------------------------------------<br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/mauricebenard/">https://www.instagram.com/mauricebenard/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/mauricebenard">https://twitter.com/mauricebenard</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/MauriceBenard/">https://www.facebook.com/MauriceBenard/</a><br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/mbstateofmind/">https://www.instagram.com/mbstateofmind/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/mbstateofmind">https://twitter.com/mbstateofmind</a><br />Learn more about State Of Mind at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.mbstateofmind.com.">https://www.mbstateofmind.com.</a><br /><br />If you'd like to learn more about my life, I've recently released &quot;Nothing General About It - How Love (and Lithium) Saved Me On and Off General Hospital&quot; <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0062973371?tag=harpercollinsus-20">https://www.amazon.com/dp/0062973371?tag=harpercollinsus-20</a>{% endraw %}
