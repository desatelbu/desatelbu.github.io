{% raw %}The House that Would Not Die (1972). A woman and her niece move into an ancestral house in the Amish countryside haunted by two ghosts from the Revolutionary War. Ruth Bennett and her niece Sara Dunning move into the house of Ruth's recently deceased aunt and shortly thereafter they learn the house is possessed by two ghosts of the original owners who were from the time of the Revolutionary War. Shortly after arriving Ruth discovers a family Bible hidden in a secret compartment of a roll top desk. Contained within is the name of the original owner which includes the name of his deceased wife and also a name that has been crossed out in ink. As the movie progresses we learn the identity of this person and the reason for it being obliterated through the possession of niece Sara and Pat McDougal. Starring Barbara Stanwyck, Richard Egan, and Michael Anderson Jr. Gotta love Barbara Stanwyck in one of her last movies, a haunted house mystery!<br />Want to watch your favorite retro movies on DVD?
