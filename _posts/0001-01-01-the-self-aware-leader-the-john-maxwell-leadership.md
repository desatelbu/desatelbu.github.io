{% raw %}“To know yourself, you must sacrifice the illusion that you already do.” –Vironika Tugaleva <br /><br />In John Maxwell’s new book, The Self-Aware Leader, he states that fools want to conquer the world, while the wise want to conquer themselves. When we understand ourselves better, we understand our strengths and weaknesses better, and we are able to unleash our teams to accomplish great things! In this episode, we are celebrating John’s new book by releasing a lesson in which he talks about what it means to be a self-aware leader! <br /><br />During the application portion of the episode, Mark Cole and Chris Goede examine the importance of self-awareness in leadership. They also discuss what they are learning throughout their own journeys toward becoming more self-aware leaders.  <br /><br />Our BONUS resource for this episode is the Self-Aware Leader Worksheet, which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching. You can download the worksheet by visiting MaxwellPodcast.com/Aware and clicking “Download the Bonus Resource.” <br /><br />References: <br />The Self-Aware Leader by John C.
