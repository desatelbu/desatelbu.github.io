{% raw %}This video is part of our new series Paper Cuts, in which you get to be hypnotized by artists doing incredible things with paper, scissors, glue sticks and X-Acto knives.<br /><br />»Subscribe to CBC Arts to watch more videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/CBCArtsSubscribe">http://bit.ly/CBCArtsSubscribe</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Calgary artist Sam Heidinger made her first paper cut of Godzilla eating a train. Back then, the medium was necessary — she didn't have any money, and it was her boyfriend's birthday. But you know the old quote about the mother of invention. Now, Heidinger has mastered the art of cutting.<br /><br />In this video by filmmaker Asim Haque, you’ll see Heidinger as she carefully, so carefully cuts a piece dear to our hearts — it’s the CBC Arts logo! (Which you can see as the logo on our channel right now for the rest of this month.
