{% raw %}The theory of ancient aliens is indeed a popular one for a number of reasons. For starters, it is extremely enticing because it discusses a world much larger than what we are led to believe. Secondly, some of the theories honestly do serve as fillers for explaining some of the greatest mysteries in our world. The reality is we still have tons of mysteries that no one can logically explain.<br /><br />For those who are unfamiliar with ancient alien theories, they discuss the possibility of extra-terrestrials visiting us in ancient times and helping humanity to progress and develop their civilizations. As strange as this may sound, the fact is that there are several instances in religions where they talk about beings that strangely resemble what we perceive to be aliens. From nuclear wars to spaceships, these concepts have been discussed in ancient religious texts written thousands of years ago.<br /><br />The whole concept of ancient aliens is interesting in itself. Add it to the grand mythologies of religion and you get a gold mine of exciting fantasy-like stories. Most of these may sound ridiculous at first glance but as you delve more into it, you will find yourself falling into a wonderful rabbit hole.<br /><br />Here are 8 incredible instances of aliens and religion coming together.<br /><br />[Narrated by Soma Song  ]<br />Check out his channel<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG24xtkxWTB1GVPcacVuGCQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG24xtkxWTB1GVPcacVuGCQ</a><br /><br />Books And Reading Material [ Affiliate links  ]<br /><br />Alien Reptilian Legacy<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3kvHcri">https://amzn.to/3kvHcri</a><br /><br />Alien World Order: The Reptilian Plan to Divide and Conquer the Human Race<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3kzg9vo">https://amzn.to/3kzg9vo</a><br /><br />Ancient World Aliens<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3b1o951">https://amzn.to/3b1o951</a><br /><br />The Serpent Cult: Origins of Sacred Religion<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3bJHiHX">https://amzn.to/3bJHiHX</a><br /><br />The Extraterrestrial Species Almanac: The Ultimate Guide to Greys, Reptilians, Hybrids, and Nordics (MUFON)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2AW4Hri">https://amzn.to/2AW4Hri</a><br /><br />Book of Alien Race: Secret Russian KGB Book of Alien Species (Blue Planet Project 19)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/32dvFpp">https://amzn.to/32dvFpp</a><br /><br />ETs Among Us 4: The Reality of ET / Human Hybrids<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2C29NTi">https://amzn.to/2C29NTi</a><br /><br />Ancient Rite by Kevin MacLeod<br />Link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://filmmusic.io/song/5739-ancient-rite">https://filmmusic.io/song/5739-ancient-rite</a><br />License: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</a><br /><br />Paypal&quot;: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.me/whatweknow">https://www.paypal.me/whatweknow</a><br /><br />Join this channel to get access to perks:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLjgaAnMxKEUBihAeuaudmw/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLjgaAnMxKEUBihAeuaudmw/join</a><br /><br />ðŸ”” Support me â–º<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/whatweknow">https://www.patreon.com/whatweknow</a><br />ðŸ”” SUBSCRIBE TO THE whatweknow â–º<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLjgaAnMxKEUBihAeuaudmw?view_as=subscriber">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLjgaAnMxKEUBihAeuaudmw?view_as=subscriber</a><br /><br />ðŸ”” Follow me on Facebookâ–º<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/whatweknow05/">https://www.facebook.com/whatweknow05/</a>{% endraw %}
