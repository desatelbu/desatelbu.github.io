{% raw %}Causes of Spinal Cord Injuries | Causes, Effects and Classifications | Neuroanatomy<br /><br />Click here to learn more about treatment of Spinal Cord Injury: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://age2b.com/spinal-cord-injury-treatment">https://age2b.com/spinal-cord-injury-treatment</a><br /><br />Road trauma and falls from a height are common causes of spinal cord injuries. More than half of all spinal cord injuries occur because of motor vehicle accidents.<br /><br />In most cases, the mechanism of spinal cord injury caused by physical trauma is compression of the spinal cord by fragments of fractured vertebrae. Disc problems, such as herniation or bulging, may also cause spinal cord injury.<br /><br />Overgrowth of vertebral bone tissue can also be the reason behind a slow and progressive spinal cord injury in any region of the spine. With age, ligaments that bind the spine together become thickened and stiff. These ligaments can take up space in the spinal canal and cause progressive spinal cord injuries. Spinal cord injuries can occur due to tumors that grow in the spine.<br /><br />#spinalcord #vertebrae #spinalcordinjurycauses #spine{% endraw %}
