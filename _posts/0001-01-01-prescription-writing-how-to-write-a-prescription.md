Date: The date on which prescription is written.<br />2. The identity, age, sex, breed of an animal and address of owner also be mentioned.<br />3. Superscription: It consists of the symbol Rx, an abbreviation of the Latin word recipe which means ‚Äútake thou of‚Äù.<br />4. Inscription: The inscription is the body of the prescription which lists the names and the amount of drugs to be incorporated in the prescription.<br />5. Subscription: The subscription directs pharmacist, dispenser what to make from ingredients i.e. mixture, liniment, ointment etc. and the quantity of the formulation to dispense.<br />6. The Signa (Sig. or S.) or Signature: The signature does not refer to the prescriber‚Äôs signature but it is derived from the Latin word ‚ÄòSignature‚Äô which means ‚Äòlet it be labeled‚Äô. It is the part of the prescription where the prescriber instructs the pharmacist what he wishes to be written on the label of the dispended product. Occasionally, this part of the prescription order is called the transcription.<br />7. Prescriber‚Äôs Signature: The signature of the practitioner must appear on the prescription to make it a legal document. Physician‚Äôs full name his/her address and his/her registration number may also be mentioned.<br /><br />Chapters:<br />0:00 - intro<br />0:23 - What is a prescription ?<br />0:49 - History of Prescription<br />01:38 - Types of Prescription<br />03:05 - Parts of Prescription (Prescription Format)<br />03:38 - A sample Prescription<br />05:20 - Prescription Errors<br /><br />Don't click this link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3vfeMa4">https://bit.ly/3vfeMa4</a> <br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://web.facebook.com/pharmacyd0929">https://web.facebook.com/pharmacyd0929</a><br /><br />For any Queries and Suggestions Email on: pharmacyd0929@gmail.com<br /><br />Disclaimer:<br />&quot;Content is For Education Purpose Only, Creamed From Various Authentic Books of Pharmacy &amp; Medicine.&quot;<br />A Famous Quote is: &quot;What We Know is a Drop.
