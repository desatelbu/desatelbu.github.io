{% raw %}Hey All,<br /><br />So i kind of did a booboo and made the mage tower trivial.<br /><br />here's a guide for the Mage tower for Balance druid!  It utilizes cyclone to make the mobs act in unintended ways, but the mage tower is still easily doable even without doing this sneaky little trick.  I'm really happy they brought back the mage towers for Shadowlands, and I want to get as many done in this 2 week period as possible.  It really is a challenge to complete a few of them, I heard the guardian druid mage tower is especially tough :x.  I kind of hope they keep this bug in for the mage tower challenges in 9.1.5 and 9.2 so I don't have to take the video down :P <br /><br /><br /><br />Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/GzyfG4mgAG">https://discord.gg/GzyfG4mgAG</a><br />Twitch:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/shew">https://www.twitch.tv/shew</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/shewwow">https://twitter.com/shewwow</a><br /><br />Love Y'all,<br /><br />Shew<br /><br />#worldofwarcraft #magetower #balancedruid{% endraw %}
