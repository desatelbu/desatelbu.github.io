{% raw %}Winston Churchill was much more than the British Bulldog who held Britain together during the Blitz. He was also a prisoner of war with a bounty on his head who secretly sold paintings from a Paris art gallery - and that's just the beginning when it comes to weird Winston Churchill facts.<br /><br />Did you know that Churchill once ordered firefighters to let a London building burn to the ground rather than try to save the people inside? Or that 50 years before the Blitz, a teenage Churchill predicted, &quot;I tell you London will be in danger - London will be attacked and I shall be very prominent in the defense of London?&quot; Or that Churchill once jumped up during a dinner party, told his kitchen staff to run for a shelter, and sat back down three minutes before a bomb destroyed his kitchen?<br /><br />These strange facts about Winston Churchill might seem like fiction, but they're all true.<br /><br />#WinstonChurchill #BritishHistory #WeirdHistory{% endraw %}
