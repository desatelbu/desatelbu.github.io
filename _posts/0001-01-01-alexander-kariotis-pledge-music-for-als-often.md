{% raw %}Hello everyone! Pledge here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/alexanderkariotis">http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/alexanderkariotis</a><br />Together let's be the cure!<br /><br />It's time again . . . time for me to share some NEW MUSIC! I'm very excited about my debut album for two reasons:<br /><br />*1) I've spent the last several years creating something special, something new and 100% &quot;me&quot;, and I cannot wait for people to hear it!.<br /><br />*2) I am going to use this project to give a voice to a special mission I am very passionate about -- helping assist families who are affected by ALS, more commonly known as Lou Gehrig's Disease. I lost my brother to ALS, and we could not have gotten through it without the care and help of many agencies and people. Losing my brother is what led me to write this album, so I would like to use my music to give something back.<br /><br />My mission is to use my performances as a way to raise awareness for the local groups that serve the ALS patients and their families wherever we are playing. I would like to do special fundraisers and appearances to help financially support families who are directly affected by ALS. ALS is a very expensive and fast moving disease, and it can be a huge financial struggle to afford the equipment and care you need to take care of your loved one. I want to use my music to help bridge the gap and bring a little relief to those affected.<br /><br />In joining me here at PledgeMusic, you'll have the chance to get all of my exclusive updates and videos about what I'm doing, how things are progressing, and what's next in the process. Sounds fun, right?<br /><br />Let's take this journey through music together, and make a real difference in the world. Off we go!<br /><br />-- Alexander{% endraw %}
