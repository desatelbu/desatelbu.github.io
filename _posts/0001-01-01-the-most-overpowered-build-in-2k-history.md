{% raw %}Tall Point forwards have been around for years and years in NBA 2K. In 2K17 we had 6'10 point forwards that were completely overpowered. In 2K18 we had those same 6'10 point forwards running not only the park but the pro am scene as well. The years went on and the point forwards continued to dominate, now its time to bring these back for NBA 2K22!{% endraw %}
