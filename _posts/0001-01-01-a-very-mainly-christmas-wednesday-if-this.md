{% raw %}If this is your first sessions - hi there. If you've watched a previous session, welcome back.<br />Have you got bells and a scarf (or a set of keys and a paper serviette/napkin - they'll work too). And if your mainly music group gave you the book, A Very mainly Christmas, bring that too because we're going to read it to you. Don't forget your 5 Little Angels props as well.<br />Get ready ... this is Wednesday, 15 December{% endraw %}
