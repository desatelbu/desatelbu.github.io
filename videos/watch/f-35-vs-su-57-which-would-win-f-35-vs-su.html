Overview&lt;br /&gt;F-35 is a multipurpose combat aircraft designed to perform strike missions. F-35 comes with 3 variants F-35A, F-35B and F-35C, all with different functions… On the other hand, the Su-57 is a fifth generation air-superiority aircraft designed to destroy all types of air, ground and naval targets. As of today, Sukhoi has developed 10 prototypes and 2 serial units. The Defense Ministry of Russia planned to acquire a total of 76 aircraft for the Russian airforce…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Design &amp;amp; Stealth&lt;br /&gt;The F-35 is 51.4ft in length and 14.4ft in height, while the wingspan of the aircraft is 35ft. The airframe was designed with lowest possible RCS and the jet is coated with radar-absorbent materials…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the contrary, the SU-57 is a bigger plane measuring 66ft in length and 15ft in height. The aircraft comes with wingspan of 46ft. The SU-57 design emphasizes on frontal stealth instead of all-aspect stealth aircraft. The airframe of the jet was designed with sharper edge alignments to reduce the RCS…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Performance&lt;br /&gt;The F-35 is powered by a single Pratt &amp;amp; Whitney engine producing 43,000 pounds of thrust. With the help of this engine, the aircraft can flies vertically into the sky. The jet can gain top speed of Mach 1.6. The aircraft has maximum range of 1,700mi and can perform combat operations within the radius of 770mi.The F35 can climb at rate of 45,000 ft/min and can reach at maximum altitude of 50,000ft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other side, the Russian aircraft is powered by a pair of afterburning turbofan engines generating 64,000 pounds of thrust combined. These engines can push the aircraft to top speed of Mach 2. The fighter jet has a maximum range of 2175mi on internal fuel. While combat radius of the aircraft is classified, however some defense analysts estimate it around 750mi. The Su-57 can climb at a pace of 70,800 ft/min and reach at a maximum height of 66,000ft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Maneuverability&lt;br /&gt;As per the F-35 manufacturer, the maneuvering restrictions imposed initially are now removed. The jet can perform high angle of attack maneuvers…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, SU-57 performs very high angles of attack maneuvers such as the Pugachev’s Cobra, bell maneuver and flat rotations…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Radar &amp;amp; Avionics&lt;br /&gt;The F35 is equipped with latest AN/APG-81 radar capable of tracking 23 targets in 9 seconds and engaging 19 of them in 2.4 seconds. The range of F35 radar is confidential; however some defense analysts believe that the radar can detect an 11sqft target from 250 to 300mi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, the SU-57 is equipped with AESA radar capable of detecting and tracking in the presence of electronic countermeasures. With the help of X- and L-band modes, the aircraft can even detect hostile stealth aircraft. The estimated range of the radar to detect a11 sqft target is around 249mi. F-35’s ability to understand the battle space is like none other. The aircraft is literally loaded with sensors. The aircraft’ sensor fusion generates…On the other side, SU-57 is outfitted with latest avionics with high level of automation and intelligent crew support. The integrated avionics suite can automatically…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Firepower&lt;br /&gt;The F-35 comes with two internal weapon bays outfitted with 4 weapon stations and 6 external hardpoints. The two inboard stations are armed with air-to-air missiles…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, the Su-57 has two main internal weapon bays. For air-to-air engagements, SU-57 is internally armed with 4 BVR missiles and 2 short-range missiles. For longer range engagements, the aircraft is armed with four BVR missiles with range in excess of 186mi…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For detailed conclusion, watch the complete video.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOLLOW us on Social Media:&lt;br /&gt;► Facebook: facebook.com/thegrid88&lt;br /&gt;► Twitter: twitter.com/grid_88&lt;br /&gt;► Become a Patreon: www.patreon.com/grid88&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Playlists&lt;br /&gt;► Military, Army, Navy &amp;amp; Air force&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_MU4G4BubMS7mxsl0e1ZL_196-zHUfdz&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_MU4G4BubMS7mxsl0e1ZL_196-zHUfdz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;►US Army&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_MU4G4BubMQQCvYSWEH8glvcWTMT2ohy&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_MU4G4BubMQQCvYSWEH8glvcWTMT2ohy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;► Russian Army&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_MU4G4BubMQrt8Wz0MYm26YJD2eIt7hu&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_MU4G4BubMQrt8Wz0MYm26YJD2eIt7hu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;► SUBSCRIBE so you never miss another video: &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;http://goo.gl/UYzU9H&quot;&gt;http://goo.gl/UYzU9H&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Credits&lt;br /&gt;1) “The Descent&quot; Kevin MacLeod Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/&quot;&gt;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) US DOD&lt;br /&gt;3) Lockheed Martin&lt;br /&gt;4) Минобороны России&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/&quot;&gt;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All content on Grid 88 is presented for educational &amp;amp; entertainment purposes.

Overview<br />F-35 is a multipurpose combat aircraft designed to perform strike missions. F-35 comes with 3 variants F-35A, F-35B and F-35C, all with different functions… On the other hand, the Su-57 is a fifth generation air-superiority aircraft designed to destroy all types of air, ground and naval targets. As of today, Sukhoi has developed 10 prototypes and 2 serial units. The Defense Ministry of Russia planned to acquire a total of 76 aircraft for the Russian airforce…<br /><br />2. Design &amp; Stealth<br />The F-35 is 51.4ft in length and 14.4ft in height, while the wingspan of the aircraft is 35ft. The airframe was designed with lowest possible RCS and the jet is coated with radar-absorbent materials…<br /><br />On the contrary, the SU-57 is a bigger plane measuring 66ft in length and 15ft in height. The aircraft comes with wingspan of 46ft. The SU-57 design emphasizes on frontal stealth instead of all-aspect stealth aircraft. The airframe of the jet was designed with sharper edge alignments to reduce the RCS…<br /><br />3. Performance<br />The F-35 is powered by a single Pratt &amp; Whitney engine producing 43,000 pounds of thrust. With the help of this engine, the aircraft can flies vertically into the sky. The jet can gain top speed of Mach 1.6. The aircraft has maximum range of 1,700mi and can perform combat operations within the radius of 770mi.The F35 can climb at rate of 45,000 ft/min and can reach at maximum altitude of 50,000ft.<br /><br />On the other side, the Russian aircraft is powered by a pair of afterburning turbofan engines generating 64,000 pounds of thrust combined. These engines can push the aircraft to top speed of Mach 2. The fighter jet has a maximum range of 2175mi on internal fuel. While combat radius of the aircraft is classified, however some defense analysts estimate it around 750mi. The Su-57 can climb at a pace of 70,800 ft/min and reach at a maximum height of 66,000ft.<br /><br />4. Maneuverability<br />As per the F-35 manufacturer, the maneuvering restrictions imposed initially are now removed. The jet can perform high angle of attack maneuvers…<br /><br />On the other hand, SU-57 performs very high angles of attack maneuvers such as the Pugachev’s Cobra, bell maneuver and flat rotations…<br /><br />5. Radar &amp; Avionics<br />The F35 is equipped with latest AN/APG-81 radar capable of tracking 23 targets in 9 seconds and engaging 19 of them in 2.4 seconds. The range of F35 radar is confidential; however some defense analysts believe that the radar can detect an 11sqft target from 250 to 300mi.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the SU-57 is equipped with AESA radar capable of detecting and tracking in the presence of electronic countermeasures. With the help of X- and L-band modes, the aircraft can even detect hostile stealth aircraft. The estimated range of the radar to detect a11 sqft target is around 249mi. F-35’s ability to understand the battle space is like none other. The aircraft is literally loaded with sensors. The aircraft’ sensor fusion generates…On the other side, SU-57 is outfitted with latest avionics with high level of automation and intelligent crew support. The integrated avionics suite can automatically…<br /><br />6. Firepower<br />The F-35 comes with two internal weapon bays outfitted with 4 weapon stations and 6 external hardpoints. The two inboard stations are armed with air-to-air missiles…<br /><br />On the other hand, the Su-57 has two main internal weapon bays. For air-to-air engagements, SU-57 is internally armed with 4 BVR missiles and 2 short-range missiles. For longer range engagements, the aircraft is armed with four BVR missiles with range in excess of 186mi…<br /><br />For detailed conclusion, watch the complete video.<br /><br />FOLLOW us on Social Media:<br />► Facebook: facebook.com/thegrid88<br />► Twitter: twitter.com/grid_88<br />► Become a Patreon: www.patreon.com/grid88<br /><br />Playlists<br />► Military, Army, Navy &amp; Air force<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_MU4G4BubMS7mxsl0e1ZL_196-zHUfdz">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_MU4G4BubMS7mxsl0e1ZL_196-zHUfdz</a><br /><br />►US Army<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_MU4G4BubMQQCvYSWEH8glvcWTMT2ohy">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_MU4G4BubMQQCvYSWEH8glvcWTMT2ohy</a><br /><br />► Russian Army<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_MU4G4BubMQrt8Wz0MYm26YJD2eIt7hu">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_MU4G4BubMQrt8Wz0MYm26YJD2eIt7hu</a><br /><br />► SUBSCRIBE so you never miss another video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/UYzU9H">http://goo.gl/UYzU9H</a><br />Credits<br />1) “The Descent" Kevin MacLeod Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</a><br />2) US DOD<br />3) Lockheed Martin<br />4) Минобороны России<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</a><br /><br />All content on Grid 88 is presented for educational &amp; entertainment purposes.
