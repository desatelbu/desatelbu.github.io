The more speculative picks are volatile (can definitely drop in the next few months or explode) but could result in very high gains over the long term, and the safer ones should make you a healthy profit over the next decade or longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to watch the full video to get an analysis of each company and what they have to offer! You’ll have a better understanding of each company, which is crucial before deciding to invest. I always tell people who are getting into investing, short term any great stock can fall. But in the long term, a great stock will always perform well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I’ve done the research and I’ll share with you my findings, analysis, and opinions on each company. In this video, I go over a wide range of companies ranging from tech, to gaming, to the metaverse and car buying/selling. Some are growth stocks, and some aren’t as &quot;momentum&quot; based. These are the stocks to buy now in December 2021.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are LONG TERM PICKS - for short term, all of these companies can go down or up. Do NOT trade options with these companies as their price movement can be all over the place, especially during earnings. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note - I have an interest in some of these companies. These are not recommendations and are just a suggestion to do further research- I encourage you to do your own research about each company and make a decision for yourself, whether or not you want to invest in that particular company. This video should not be considered financial advice. I am not a financial advisor. Do NOT buy a stock just because it was on this video. This video is just my own analysis of 7 companies and the current news surrounding them. You must do your own research before considering investing in a company (I recommend 1 hour minimum research per company).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also - if you want a more technical analysis, there are other channels that will dive deep into the numbers :) I like to talk about the news and where the company lies in the industry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy stock buying! Please be careful because many stocks are at all time highs, and as much as I’d love the momentum to keep carrying on, it can’t last forever. I can’t reiterate this enough, but index fund investing is the best way to invest for long term wealth, so if you can try and keep a small portion of your portfolio in individual companies. A MAJORITY of my money is kept in index funds like VOO (IVV is very similar and has the same expense ratio which is great).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please SHARE this video with a friend who could benefit.

The more speculative picks are volatile (can definitely drop in the next few months or explode) but could result in very high gains over the long term, and the safer ones should make you a healthy profit over the next decade or longer.<br /><br />Make sure to watch the full video to get an analysis of each company and what they have to offer! You’ll have a better understanding of each company, which is crucial before deciding to invest. I always tell people who are getting into investing, short term any great stock can fall. But in the long term, a great stock will always perform well.<br /><br />So, I’ve done the research and I’ll share with you my findings, analysis, and opinions on each company. In this video, I go over a wide range of companies ranging from tech, to gaming, to the metaverse and car buying/selling. Some are growth stocks, and some aren’t as "momentum" based. These are the stocks to buy now in December 2021.<br /><br />These are LONG TERM PICKS - for short term, all of these companies can go down or up. Do NOT trade options with these companies as their price movement can be all over the place, especially during earnings. <br /><br />Note - I have an interest in some of these companies. These are not recommendations and are just a suggestion to do further research- I encourage you to do your own research about each company and make a decision for yourself, whether or not you want to invest in that particular company. This video should not be considered financial advice. I am not a financial advisor. Do NOT buy a stock just because it was on this video. This video is just my own analysis of 7 companies and the current news surrounding them. You must do your own research before considering investing in a company (I recommend 1 hour minimum research per company).<br /><br />Also - if you want a more technical analysis, there are other channels that will dive deep into the numbers :) I like to talk about the news and where the company lies in the industry.<br /><br />Happy stock buying! Please be careful because many stocks are at all time highs, and as much as I’d love the momentum to keep carrying on, it can’t last forever. I can’t reiterate this enough, but index fund investing is the best way to invest for long term wealth, so if you can try and keep a small portion of your portfolio in individual companies. A MAJORITY of my money is kept in index funds like VOO (IVV is very similar and has the same expense ratio which is great).<br /><br />Please SHARE this video with a friend who could benefit.
