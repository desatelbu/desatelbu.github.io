It was one of my first adventures psalming with my dulcimer.  As I went through, there were several things that stood out to me, that rang true in my heart.  But my favorite word by far in this chapter is the word “fastened.”  It caught hold of me and I couldn’t let it go.  I felt like that was the perfect description of how my heartfelt about heaven.  I started shaping a new song from that thought, and really could only settle on the chorus.  I tucked it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of months later, I got a text from my 18-year-old son saying “I think my friend Solomon got killed.”  I began to walk him through what ended up being a very tough day.  He drove an hour to meet up with this family and all his friends to hear what was going on.  Grant Solomon went to heaven that day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That evening, all the kids met up and we worshipped with them on the school lawn.  It was the first time we would see a rainbow, which continued every day until his memorial, a full week.  &lt;br /&gt;But as we cried and prayed, I heard Grant’s mom, Angie.  She was crying from such a deep place, and it wrecked me.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next morning, I pulled this song back out.  It was time.  I translated what I felt in Angie’s cries, and wrote this song for her and Grant.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a really hard time deciding when would be best to share it with her.  My husband Eric randomly posted it one day, 5 months or so later, when I sang it at a writer’s round for the first time.  I texted Angie until midnight that night, as she told me her birthday was that next day, and she had been needing to hear from the Lord.  So this song became a birthday gift for her, really from the Lord and Grant.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a feeling someone else may need to hear this encouragement today too.  This world will fade, we are fastened to heaven.  If you’re feeling homesick, it’s ok.&lt;/p&gt;\n", "thumbnailUrl": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eoFLWPl0hAI/hqdefault.jpg", "uploadDate": "2021-02-20T15:30:15Z", "duration": "PT4M47S", "contentUrl": "https://desatelbu.github.io/videos/watch/fastened-feat-anthem-krissy-nordhoff-official", "interactionCount": "636" }

It was one of my first adventures psalming with my dulcimer.  As I went through, there were several things that stood out to me, that rang true in my heart.  But my favorite word by far in this chapter is the word “fastened.”  It caught hold of me and I couldn’t let it go.  I felt like that was the perfect description of how my heartfelt about heaven.  I started shaping a new song from that thought, and really could only settle on the chorus.  I tucked it away.<br /><br />A couple of months later, I got a text from my 18-year-old son saying “I think my friend Solomon got killed.”  I began to walk him through what ended up being a very tough day.  He drove an hour to meet up with this family and all his friends to hear what was going on.  Grant Solomon went to heaven that day.<br /><br />That evening, all the kids met up and we worshipped with them on the school lawn.  It was the first time we would see a rainbow, which continued every day until his memorial, a full week.  <br />But as we cried and prayed, I heard Grant’s mom, Angie.  She was crying from such a deep place, and it wrecked me.  <br /><br />The next morning, I pulled this song back out.  It was time.  I translated what I felt in Angie’s cries, and wrote this song for her and Grant.  <br /><br />I had a really hard time deciding when would be best to share it with her.  My husband Eric randomly posted it one day, 5 months or so later, when I sang it at a writer’s round for the first time.  I texted Angie until midnight that night, as she told me her birthday was that next day, and she had been needing to hear from the Lord.  So this song became a birthday gift for her, really from the Lord and Grant.  <br /><br />I have a feeling someone else may need to hear this encouragement today too.  This world will fade, we are fastened to heaven.  If you’re feeling homesick, it’s ok.</p>
