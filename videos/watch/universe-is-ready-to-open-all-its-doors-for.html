A Powerful Talk by Sadhguru&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of all the methods or meditations that are given in the scriptures or given by Spiritual Masters of all times, there is one method which is one of the most powerful ones to unlock the divinity, to reveal the truth hidden in your body mind complex. Today in this talk, I am gonna share that with you. This method is known as Neti, Neti. Neti Neti is a sanskrit word which in English means, not this, not this. In this method you have to discard all the layers that cover up your Divinity, that hides Your Infinite Self from you. Before you discard all the layers, you must first know what all layers make up this body mind complex. Scriptures talk about five layers. In Sanskrit they are known as koshas. For more, kindly watch my video!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rights of this video belong to Eternal Life Channel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▶Footage licensed through:&lt;br /&gt;Videoblocks &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▶Copyright Disclaimer: &lt;br /&gt;I own the commercial license for all the content used in this video.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve used Sadhguru’s content in my video with his kind permission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“This life for me is an endeavor to help people experience and express their divinity. May you know the bliss of the Divine.” - SADHGURU&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About Sadhguru:&lt;br /&gt;Sadhguru, a yogi and profound mystic of our times, is a visionary humanitarian and a prominent spiritual leader. A contemporary Guru, rooted as strongly in mundane and pragmatic matters as he is in inner experience and wisdom, Sadhguru works tirelessly towards the physical, mental, and spiritual well-being of all. His mastery of the mechanisms of life, an outcome of his profound experience of the Self, guides in exploring the subtler dimensions of life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At home in loincloth as much as he is in blue jeans, barefoot through the mighty Himalayas, or straddling a BMW motorcycle on the expressway, Sadhguru is the most unusual mystic that one can encounter. Marking a clear departure from mere customs and rituals, Sadhguru’s scientific methods for self-transformation are both direct and powerful. Belonging to no particular tradition, Sadhguru incorporates and presents what is most valid for the contemporary life from the yogic sciences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadhguru speaks at some of the world’s most prominent international leadership forums. In January 2007, he participated in four panels at the World Economic Forum and spoke on issues ranging from diplomacy and economic development, to education and the environment. In 2006, he addressed the World Economic Forum, the Tallberg Forum in Sweden, and the Australian Leadership Retreat. He has also served as a delegate to the United Nations Millennium Peace Summit and the World Peace Congress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadhguru’s vision and understanding of modern social and economic issues have led to interviews with BBC, Bloomberg, CNBC, CNNfn, and Newsweek International. His insights are regularly featured in India’s leading national newspapers. A well-known public figure, he regularly draws crowds of more than 300,000 people for his public talks and &quot;sathsangs&quot; (group meditation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Traversing seamlessly from the ancient to the ultramodern, Sadhguru bridges the gap between the known and the unknown, enabling all those who encounter him to explore and experience the deepest dimensions of life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Download Sadhguru App here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;http://isha.sadhguru.org/app/&quot;&gt;http://isha.sadhguru.org/app/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More Videos &amp;amp; Blogs on Website &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.isha.sadhguru.org&quot;&gt;http://www.isha.sadhguru.org&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Subscribe to Sadhguru’s channel here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/sadhguru&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/user/sadhguru&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Free Guided Meditation by Sadhguru at &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.ishafoundation.org/Ishakriya&quot;&gt;http://www.ishafoundation.org/Ishakriya&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Official Facebook Page of Sadhguru&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/sadhguru&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/sadhguru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Official Twitter Profile of Sadhguru&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SadhguruJV&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/SadhguruJV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for watching!&lt;/p&gt;\n", "thumbnailUrl": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pg-p8UFfJ4I/hqdefault.jpg", "uploadDate": "2021-11-21T14:00:19Z", "duration": "PT18M10S", "contentUrl": "https://desatelbu.github.io/videos/watch/universe-is-ready-to-open-all-its-doors-for", "interactionCount": "1754" }

Today in this talk, I am gonna share that with you. This method is known as Neti, Neti. Neti Neti is a sanskrit word which in English means, not this, not this. In this method you have to discard all the layers that cover up your Divinity, that hides Your Infinite Self from you. Before you discard all the layers, you must first know what all layers make up this body mind complex. Scriptures talk about five layers. In Sanskrit they are known as koshas.

May you know the bliss of the Divine.” - SADHGURU<br /><br />About Sadhguru:<br />Sadhguru, a yogi and profound mystic of our times, is a visionary humanitarian and a prominent spiritual leader. A contemporary Guru, rooted as strongly in mundane and pragmatic matters as he is in inner experience and wisdom, Sadhguru works tirelessly towards the physical, mental, and spiritual well-being of all. His mastery of the mechanisms of life, an outcome of his profound experience of the Self, guides in exploring the subtler dimensions of life.<br /><br />At home in loincloth as much as he is in blue jeans, barefoot through the mighty Himalayas, or straddling a BMW motorcycle on the expressway, Sadhguru is the most unusual mystic that one can encounter. Marking a clear departure from mere customs and rituals, Sadhguru’s scientific methods for self-transformation are both direct and powerful. Belonging to no particular tradition, Sadhguru incorporates and presents what is most valid for the contemporary life from the yogic sciences.<br /><br />Sadhguru speaks at some of the world’s most prominent international leadership forums. In January 2007, he participated in four panels at the World Economic Forum and spoke on issues ranging from diplomacy and economic development, to education and the environment. In 2006, he addressed the World Economic Forum, the Tallberg Forum in Sweden, and the Australian Leadership Retreat. He has also served as a delegate to the United Nations Millennium Peace Summit and the World Peace Congress.<br /><br />Sadhguru’s vision and understanding of modern social and economic issues have led to interviews with BBC, Bloomberg, CNBC, CNNfn, and Newsweek International. His insights are regularly featured in India’s leading national newspapers. A well-known public figure, he regularly draws crowds of more than 300,000 people for his public talks and "sathsangs" (group meditation).<br /><br />Traversing seamlessly from the ancient to the ultramodern, Sadhguru bridges the gap between the known and the unknown, enabling all those who encounter him to explore and experience the deepest dimensions of life.<br /><br />Download Sadhguru App here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://isha.sadhguru.org/app/">http://isha.sadhguru.org/app/</a><br /><br />More Videos &amp; Blogs on Website <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.isha.sadhguru.org">http://www.isha.sadhguru.org</a> <br /><br />Subscribe to Sadhguru’s channel here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/sadhguru">https://www.youtube.com/user/sadhguru</a><br /><br />Free Guided Meditation by Sadhguru at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.ishafoundation.org/Ishakriya">http://www.ishafoundation.org/Ishakriya</a> <br /><br />Official Facebook Page of Sadhguru<br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/sadhguru">https://www.facebook.com/sadhguru</a> <br /><br />Official Twitter Profile of Sadhguru<br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/SadhguruJV">https://twitter.com/SadhguruJV</a><br /><br />Thank you for watching!</p>
