The Monkeys serve as an income generator, allowing a player to earn MonkeyBucks ($MBS) by winning matches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Monkey NFTs are more than just a beautiful collectible. Each Monkey NFT has a unique DNA composed of his cool Appearance, Trainable Abilities (Accuracy, Passing, Strength and Control) and Special Elements, unique to his role (Scorer, Defender, Midfielder or Goalkeeper). A Monkey’s DNA and rarity affects the player’s ability to play and win matches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generation zero of Monkeys will be limited to 5000 Monkeys out of nearly 4 Billion permutations possible, dictating the rarity of each NFT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holding an original Monkey gives you special perks such as:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Airdrop of game tokens&lt;br /&gt;Advance your player in a pre-game training camp&lt;br /&gt;Early Breeding season&lt;br /&gt;Early access to Stadium (land) sale&lt;br /&gt;NFT drop is planned for December 2021&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is MonkeyBall?&lt;br /&gt;MonkeyBall is a quick, turn-based, Play-to-Earn, arcade, soccer game offering a high-production-value gaming experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matches are played between two teams, each with 4 Monkeys playing the positions of Scorer, Defender, Midfielder and Goalkeeper. With 6 rounds of play per half, the first team to 3 goals wins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back at HQ, boost your Monkeys’ abilities and in-game performance by caring for and training them, as well as increasing their morale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stadium owners are rewarded for matches they host, while other players can be spectators and influence the gameplay by cheering for a winning team to increase their gameplay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a match ends, the in-game currency token, MonkeyBucks ($MBS), is split between the winning team, the Stadium owner, and the spectators who rooted for the winning team.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER: This video and its contents are for informational purposes only and do not constitute an offer to sell or trade, a solicitation to buy, or recommendation for any security, cryptocurrency, or related product, nor does it constitute an offer to provide investment advice or other related services by Kristian Peter.
