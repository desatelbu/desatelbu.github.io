If you don’t need a visa to come to Serbia, you may be able to come to Serbia first and apply directly in the police station. This might not be the case always. You may have to leave Serbia and apply through an Embassy or consulate in Skopje, for example.&lt;br /&gt;-In this case you need to get your white card.&lt;br /&gt;-If you are a citizen of a country that requires a visa, you will need to sort your visa first and many documents showing that you have grounds to get a residence permit in Serbia before actually going there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;03:48 Freelancer (self-employed)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-One of the best options to get a residence permit in Serbia is by becoming a self-employed person.&lt;br /&gt;-By owning your own company, and running it actively, you will have grounds to live in Serbia.&lt;br /&gt;-The advantage here is quite significant as you don’t have to hire anyone if you are not a citizen, and you will still be able to get a residence permit.&lt;br /&gt;-There are also no minimum financial requirements. If you have enough capital to start your activity and pay taxes, that is enough to get your residence permit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;04:30 Residence Permit by Buying Property&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The second option I would like to present is buying property in Serbia.&lt;br /&gt;-Buying property in Serbia is a great option, and it is even more flexible than starting your own business. &lt;br /&gt;-If you buy a residential property of any value, you will be eligible to apply for a residence permit in Serbia.&lt;br /&gt;-This option is one to be considered if you are a retired person (foreign pension), an investor (stock investor), but also if you want to run a business based abroad and live in Serbia.&lt;br /&gt;-You can buy a property, not necessarily live in it (you can rent it out for example), and live in a different place or even city, and still become a resident in Serbia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;05:20 Permanent residency in Serbia and Citizenship by naturalization&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To acquire permanent residency in Serbia, you need to live in the country for longer 5 years. There are some exceptions to this. If you are married to a Serbian citizen, 3 years are enough. But depending on your temporary residence permit, just half of the time counts towards permanent residency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;05:45 Serbian Citizenship:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-if you ultimate goal is to acquire Serbian citizenship, you will need at least 3 years living in Serbia as a permanent resident. So in most cases, the whole process will take a little longer than 8 years. Serbia allows dual citizenship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;06:14 Advantages of living in Serbia:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Excellent location in the middle of Europe.&lt;br /&gt;-One of the most flexible residence permit policies in the European continent. Especially when it comes to residence by real estate.&lt;br /&gt;-Quality of life (safety, weather)&lt;br /&gt;-Relatively low income and capital gains tax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;07:37 Disadvantages&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Inefficient bureaucracy.&lt;br /&gt;-High taxes (if you don’t structure your business well).&lt;br /&gt;-Low income (which can be an advantage or a disadvantage).&lt;/p&gt;\n", "thumbnailUrl": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hARDaSe3PRE/hqdefault.jpg", "uploadDate": "2021-05-20T09:47:06Z", "duration": "PT10M11S", "contentUrl": "https://desatelbu.github.io/videos/watch/how-to-move-to-serbia-residence-permit-taxes", "interactionCount": "7011" }

If you don’t need a visa to come to Serbia, you may be able to come to Serbia first and apply directly in the police station. This might not be the case always. You may have to leave Serbia and apply through an Embassy or consulate in Skopje, for example.<br />-In this case you need to get your white card.<br />-If you are a citizen of a country that requires a visa, you will need to sort your visa first and many documents showing that you have grounds to get a residence permit in Serbia before actually going there.<br /><br />03:48 Freelancer (self-employed)<br /><br />-One of the best options to get a residence permit in Serbia is by becoming a self-employed person.<br />-By owning your own company, and running it actively, you will have grounds to live in Serbia.<br />-The advantage here is quite significant as you don’t have to hire anyone if you are not a citizen, and you will still be able to get a residence permit.<br />-There are also no minimum financial requirements. If you have enough capital to start your activity and pay taxes, that is enough to get your residence permit.<br /><br />04:30 Residence Permit by Buying Property<br /><br />-The second option I would like to present is buying property in Serbia.<br />-Buying property in Serbia is a great option, and it is even more flexible than starting your own business. <br />-If you buy a residential property of any value, you will be eligible to apply for a residence permit in Serbia.<br />-This option is one to be considered if you are a retired person (foreign pension), an investor (stock investor), but also if you want to run a business based abroad and live in Serbia.<br />-You can buy a property, not necessarily live in it (you can rent it out for example), and live in a different place or even city, and still become a resident in Serbia.<br /><br />05:20 Permanent residency in Serbia and Citizenship by naturalization<br /><br />To acquire permanent residency in Serbia, you need to live in the country for longer 5 years. There are some exceptions to this. If you are married to a Serbian citizen, 3 years are enough. But depending on your temporary residence permit, just half of the time counts towards permanent residency.<br /><br />05:45 Serbian Citizenship:<br /><br />-if you ultimate goal is to acquire Serbian citizenship, you will need at least 3 years living in Serbia as a permanent resident. So in most cases, the whole process will take a little longer than 8 years. Serbia allows dual citizenship.<br /><br />06:14 Advantages of living in Serbia:<br /><br />-Excellent location in the middle of Europe.<br />-One of the most flexible residence permit policies in the European continent. Especially when it comes to residence by real estate.<br />-Quality of life (safety, weather)<br />-Relatively low income and capital gains tax.<br /><br />07:37 Disadvantages<br /><br />-Inefficient bureaucracy.<br />-High taxes (if you don’t structure your business well).<br />-Low income (which can be an advantage or a disadvantage).</p>
