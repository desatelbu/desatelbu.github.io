Thank you to Orchid for sponsoring this video!

There was a pivotal moment last year when we were walking through Central Park where I turned to Michael and basically told him that I was ready. We had been together for a long time (11 years at that point), and somehow I just felt like I was ready to start trying. Quarantine also really played a role in our decision to start trying because we spent so much time together just the two of us, and we began having deeper conversations about our future and family plans. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of you asked about the genetic testing we did… we did a general panel at my doctor’s, and then used Orchid. Orchid helps couples have healthy babies. They teamed up with Stanford scientists to develop a first-of-its-kind genetic testing system to identify risks at the earliest stages. Orchid’s Couple Report tells you how your genetics influences your child’s health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Couple Report quantifies a future child’s genetic risk for schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, heart disease, atrial fibrillation, stroke, breast cancer, prostate cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, and types 1 and 2 diabetes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use code LUCIE10 for 10% off the Couple Report &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://portal.orchidhealth.com/purchase&quot;&gt;https://portal.orchidhealth.com/purchase&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sign up for the waitlist here: &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.orchidhealth.com/signup-preconception&quot;&gt;https://www.orchidhealth.com/signup-preconception&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learn more at &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.orchidhealth.com/&quot;&gt;https://www.orchidhealth.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m glad to be an Orchid user &amp;amp; partner!

I think the worst thing a couple can do is decide to have a baby to ‘patch up’ a relationship that may be teetering on the edge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Making sure we were financially secure and that we were in a good place individually &amp;amp; together.&lt;br /&gt;My excitement was definitely a factor. Just the idea of having a baby was so beyond exciting to me! I am such a kid person and I’ve yet to play any type of role in raising one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, we had no idea how long it would take us to conceive! We wanted to start trying on the earlier side, before we were beyond ready, just in case it did take us a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another massive factor was making sure we had a good support system around us. Both of our families are so excited for us, and having close friends nearby will take a lot of stress out of those first few months. Setting up a meal train and knowing that family is right around the corner is HUGE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the second half of this video, I wanted to talk a little bit more about us finding out we were pregnant together. In my head, I had always thought I would do this grand reveal to tell Michael that I was pregnant. But if you know Michael, a grand reveal is not really something that would be as meaningful to him. This was something that we wanted to go through together. I distinctly remember that, during the two-week wait, I felt a pinch on one side of my uterus and got out of bed to film a video because I was convinced that I could feel the egg implanting itself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That entire next week I felt this buzzing energy in my uterus and it felt like there was more blood flow in the area. This had me thinking I was pregnant. However, I didn’t want to get Michael’s hopes up, so I didn’t tell him too much at the time! The Friday before that third week, I got so excited that I just couldn’t wait anymore. We bought 2 pregnancy tests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out the real-time video footage to watch us finding out the news together! I hope this video gave you a little more insight into our conception journey and how we knew we were ready to start trying!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Subscribe to my channel: &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/luciebfink&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/luciebfink&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INSTAGRAM: &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.instagram.com/luciebfink&quot;&gt;http://www.instagram.com/luciebfink&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TWITTER: &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/luciebfink&quot;&gt;http://www.twitter.com/luciebfink&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FACEBOOK: &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/luciebfink&quot;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/luciebfink&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SNAPCHAT: LucieFink&lt;br /&gt;TikTok: @luciebfink&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Want to learn all of my secrets when it comes to content creation?

There was a pivotal moment last year when we were walking through Central Park where I turned to Michael and basically told him that I was ready. We had been together for a long time (11 years at that point), and somehow I just felt like I was ready to start trying. Quarantine also really played a role in our decision to start trying because we spent so much time together just the two of us, and we began having deeper conversations about our future and family plans. <br /><br />A lot of you asked about the genetic testing we did… we did a general panel at my doctor’s, and then used Orchid. Orchid helps couples have healthy babies. They teamed up with Stanford scientists to develop a first-of-its-kind genetic testing system to identify risks at the earliest stages. Orchid’s Couple Report tells you how your genetics influences your child’s health.<br /><br />The Couple Report quantifies a future child’s genetic risk for schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, heart disease, atrial fibrillation, stroke, breast cancer, prostate cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, and types 1 and 2 diabetes.<br /><br />Use code LUCIE10 for 10% off the Couple Report <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://portal.orchidhealth.com/purchase">https://portal.orchidhealth.com/purchase</a><br />Sign up for the waitlist here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.orchidhealth.com/signup-preconception">https://www.orchidhealth.com/signup-preconception</a><br />Learn more at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.orchidhealth.com/">https://www.orchidhealth.com/</a><br /><br />I’m glad to be an Orchid user &amp; partner!

I think the worst thing a couple can do is decide to have a baby to ‘patch up’ a relationship that may be teetering on the edge<br /><br />Making sure we were financially secure and that we were in a good place individually &amp; together.<br />My excitement was definitely a factor. Just the idea of having a baby was so beyond exciting to me! I am such a kid person and I’ve yet to play any type of role in raising one.<br /><br />Lastly, we had no idea how long it would take us to conceive! We wanted to start trying on the earlier side, before we were beyond ready, just in case it did take us a long time.<br /><br />Another massive factor was making sure we had a good support system around us. Both of our families are so excited for us, and having close friends nearby will take a lot of stress out of those first few months. Setting up a meal train and knowing that family is right around the corner is HUGE!<br /><br />In the second half of this video, I wanted to talk a little bit more about us finding out we were pregnant together. In my head, I had always thought I would do this grand reveal to tell Michael that I was pregnant. But if you know Michael, a grand reveal is not really something that would be as meaningful to him. This was something that we wanted to go through together. I distinctly remember that, during the two-week wait, I felt a pinch on one side of my uterus and got out of bed to film a video because I was convinced that I could feel the egg implanting itself!<br /><br />That entire next week I felt this buzzing energy in my uterus and it felt like there was more blood flow in the area. This had me thinking I was pregnant. However, I didn’t want to get Michael’s hopes up, so I didn’t tell him too much at the time! The Friday before that third week, I got so excited that I just couldn’t wait anymore. We bought 2 pregnancy tests.<br /><br />Check out the real-time video footage to watch us finding out the news together! I hope this video gave you a little more insight into our conception journey and how we knew we were ready to start trying!<br /><br />Subscribe to my channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/luciebfink">https://www.youtube.com/luciebfink</a><br />INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/luciebfink">http://www.instagram.com/luciebfink</a><br />TWITTER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/luciebfink">http://www.twitter.com/luciebfink</a><br />FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/luciebfink">http://www.facebook.com/luciebfink</a><br />SNAPCHAT: LucieFink<br />TikTok: @luciebfink<br /><br />Want to learn all of my secrets when it comes to content creation?
