I apply them once and don’t need to reapply. Some favorite scents of mine are Always Green, Delina, and Psychedelic Love.&lt;br /&gt;➡️Carved Animal Orb by Yve Sturgeon: &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/shop/TotemOrbs&quot;&gt;https://www.etsy.com/shop/TotemOrbs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought two orbs from Yve recently to serve as meditation balls, and they are truly magical.

I never wanted to experience a disorder of any kind. I felt like I could never be normal, eat normally, feel normally, or look normal to my own eyes. I am still on that journey, but the progress I’ve made is astronomical, especially since at my worst I truly believed things would not change. But they can, and they do ❤️ &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to pray that I could erase those years spent in the grips of a problem that was often invisible. But now I have taken back those memories and given them meaning and purpose by sharing and mentoring young people in my life who are experiencing similar issues. It has allowed me to forgive my illness, and use the experience to motivate me to keep building the life of my dreams: one of peace, of love, of appreciating the beauty of each and every day. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I truly believe your body is the least interesting thing about who you are, and as both men and women we can struggle with our image of ourselves, especially in a world where photos and videos are so often filtered and edited to a point that they no longer represent normal human faces, shapes, skin tones and textures. I am seriously concerned about how so many individuals showcase images of faces and bodies online that are separate from reality, selling a narrative that our bodies are only worthy of being seen if they look a certain way. “Consequently, we have more worth if we are attractive, and more deserving of love and happiness”. This is a terrifying message that makes my heart ache for the young teens growing up believing this is true. It will never be, and our worth must come from a belief in our own individual beauty, a sacred recognition of our absolute and unique majesty. True beauty is something that cannot be taken away. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ED help: &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/help-support/contact-helpline&quot;&gt;https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/help-support/contact-helpline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Resources: &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.eatingdisorderhope.com&quot;&gt;https://www.eatingdisorderhope.com&lt;/a&gt; and recoverywarriors.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;🦊🍄My Etsy Shop: &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/shop/thecottagefairyart&quot;&gt;https://www.etsy.com/shop/thecottagefairyart&lt;/a&gt; (CLOSED FOR 2021)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;🌌 This video was a collaboration with my brother, Rohan.

I never wanted to experience a disorder of any kind. I felt like I could never be normal, eat normally, feel normally, or look normal to my own eyes. I am still on that journey, but the progress I’ve made is astronomical, especially since at my worst I truly believed things would not change. But they can, and they do ❤️ <br /><br />I used to pray that I could erase those years spent in the grips of a problem that was often invisible. But now I have taken back those memories and given them meaning and purpose by sharing and mentoring young people in my life who are experiencing similar issues. It has allowed me to forgive my illness, and use the experience to motivate me to keep building the life of my dreams: one of peace, of love, of appreciating the beauty of each and every day. <br /><br />I truly believe your body is the least interesting thing about who you are, and as both men and women we can struggle with our image of ourselves, especially in a world where photos and videos are so often filtered and edited to a point that they no longer represent normal human faces, shapes, skin tones and textures. I am seriously concerned about how so many individuals showcase images of faces and bodies online that are separate from reality, selling a narrative that our bodies are only worthy of being seen if they look a certain way. “Consequently, we have more worth if we are attractive, and more deserving of love and happiness”. This is a terrifying message that makes my heart ache for the young teens growing up believing this is true. It will never be, and our worth must come from a belief in our own individual beauty, a sacred recognition of our absolute and unique majesty. True beauty is something that cannot be taken away. <br /><br />ED help: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/help-support/contact-helpline">https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/help-support/contact-helpline</a><br />Resources: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.eatingdisorderhope.com">https://www.eatingdisorderhope.com</a> and recoverywarriors.com<br /><br />🦊🍄My Etsy Shop: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/thecottagefairyart">https://www.etsy.com/shop/thecottagefairyart</a> (CLOSED FOR 2021)<br /><br />🌌 This video was a collaboration with my brother, Rohan.
