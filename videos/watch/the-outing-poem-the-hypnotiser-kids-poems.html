Quentin Blake did wonderful line drawings for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since then, I’ve been doing these things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Writing books&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Writing articles for newspapers and magazines&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going to schools, libraries and theatres and performing the poems in my books&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helping children write poems and stories&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Making radio programmes, mostly about words, language or books&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Appearing on TV, either reading books, or talking about books&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teaching at universities about children’s literature&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Running workshops for teachers about poetry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any week, I might be doing all of these things! To tell the truth, I don’t really know what I’m doing tomorrow, unless I look in my diary to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review of The Hypnotiser&lt;br /&gt;Right class 6, RIGHT CLASS 6, I’m talking, I’m talking, I want complete quiet and that includes you, David Alexander, yes you…’ ‘The Outing’, by Michael Rosen, just one of the fantastic and hilarious poems from his short story and poetry collection The Hypnotiser. This particular poem was read to me as a young child in primary school time and time again. Each time the names in the poem were changed to the names of the pupils in my class. It never got old, or less hilarious and I wouldn’t hesitate in reading this to my future classes during my teaching career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other great poems from this collection include ‘The Car Trip’; a highlight of the sibling chaos that goes on in the back of the car when Mum is driving: ‘He started it. I didn’t. He started it…’, ‘Tomato 1’; the gruelling ordeal of being given a tomato to eat by your mother and you simply just hate tomatoes, and ‘Tidy Your Room’; every child’s nightmare. Each and every poem and short story relates to children through typical experiences that most would have endured. This book enlightens children’s love and enthusiasm for poetry, an almost forgotten about genre for most children; a runner up to fiction books.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book can have many uses in the classroom; appropriate for children in Key Stage Two it can be read by the teacher at the end of the day during story time, like in my own experience at primary school. Or, during a poetry topic in Literacy, this book could model fun, interesting, age appropriate poetry that will inspire children to write their own poems. Likewise for shared reading; this book would be fantastic to put under the visualiser and look through with the class at the how poems are written, their structure, do they rhyme? do they tell a story? All sorts of things can be addressed with the class as a whole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book needs to be shown to children, whether at school on the class bookshelf, or online where you can find video clips of Michael Rosen performing these poems; a great filler for those odd five minutes that arise during the busy school day. A Must read, not just for children but teachers as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#Michael Rosen&lt;br /&gt;#Kids&lt;br /&gt;#Poetry&lt;/p&gt;\n", "thumbnailUrl": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HDyZBu73XoM/hqdefault.jpg", "uploadDate": "2008-02-18T20:28:10Z", "duration": "PT4M30S", "contentUrl": "https://desatelbu.github.io/videos/watch/the-outing-poem-the-hypnotiser-kids-poems", "interactionCount": "885304" }

Quentin Blake did wonderful line drawings for it.<br /><br />Ever since then, I’ve been doing these things:<br /><br />Writing books<br /><br />Writing articles for newspapers and magazines<br /><br />Going to schools, libraries and theatres and performing the poems in my books<br /><br />Helping children write poems and stories<br /><br />Making radio programmes, mostly about words, language or books<br /><br />Appearing on TV, either reading books, or talking about books<br /><br />Teaching at universities about children’s literature<br /><br />Running workshops for teachers about poetry<br /><br />In any week, I might be doing all of these things! To tell the truth, I don’t really know what I’m doing tomorrow, unless I look in my diary to see.<br /><br />Review of The Hypnotiser<br />Right class 6, RIGHT CLASS 6, I’m talking, I’m talking, I want complete quiet and that includes you, David Alexander, yes you…’ ‘The Outing’, by Michael Rosen, just one of the fantastic and hilarious poems from his short story and poetry collection The Hypnotiser. This particular poem was read to me as a young child in primary school time and time again. Each time the names in the poem were changed to the names of the pupils in my class. It never got old, or less hilarious and I wouldn’t hesitate in reading this to my future classes during my teaching career.<br /><br />Other great poems from this collection include ‘The Car Trip’; a highlight of the sibling chaos that goes on in the back of the car when Mum is driving: ‘He started it. I didn’t. He started it…’, ‘Tomato 1’; the gruelling ordeal of being given a tomato to eat by your mother and you simply just hate tomatoes, and ‘Tidy Your Room’; every child’s nightmare. Each and every poem and short story relates to children through typical experiences that most would have endured. This book enlightens children’s love and enthusiasm for poetry, an almost forgotten about genre for most children; a runner up to fiction books.<br /><br />This book can have many uses in the classroom; appropriate for children in Key Stage Two it can be read by the teacher at the end of the day during story time, like in my own experience at primary school. Or, during a poetry topic in Literacy, this book could model fun, interesting, age appropriate poetry that will inspire children to write their own poems. Likewise for shared reading; this book would be fantastic to put under the visualiser and look through with the class at the how poems are written, their structure, do they rhyme? do they tell a story? All sorts of things can be addressed with the class as a whole.<br /><br />This book needs to be shown to children, whether at school on the class bookshelf, or online where you can find video clips of Michael Rosen performing these poems; a great filler for those odd five minutes that arise during the busy school day. A Must read, not just for children but teachers as well!<br /><br />#Michael Rosen<br />#Kids<br />#Poetry</p>
