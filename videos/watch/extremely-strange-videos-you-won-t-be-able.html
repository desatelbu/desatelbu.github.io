But the world isn’t just made out of beautiful and astonishing things. There are mysterious and dark things that sometimes we have little to no explanation. And this is sort of what happened a couple a weeks ago when someone noticed a strange object hovering a mountain. What could it be ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nowadays almost eveyone has a phone, but a phone isn’t just a phone - it’s a multitask operational equipment with many functions one of them being taking pictures and capturing videos. The thing is just in 2016 two hundred million people went to the movies in the cinema. That’s a lot of people isn’t it ? And if you consider that most of these people have a phone someone might have captured something strange in the cinema , right ? Well , someone actually did. In Cinemex a couple were having a discussion when all of a sudden the girl with him seems to shift into someone else. What just happened here ? This scary even was caught on camera by most people there and by security cameras. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sandstorms aren’t strange at all, however when they happen at places they shouldn’t and never did - then things get strange. This is exactly what a couple of friends caught on tape when they were fishing at a lake when all of a sudden they spotted what they thought was a storm. It wasn’t , it was a sandstorm - something they had never seen in their lives and now they have to escape…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flying humanoids and witches are known in certain cultures , and in certain places they are adored and worshiped. But there’s not enough proof of their existence - a couple of weeks ago a few people saw the unthinkable and the most unusual thing ever - what appears to be a flying walking person in the sky. They were able to capture it on camera and I’ll analyze closely to see if this could actually be a flying humanoid or if it’s something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Subscribers always send me strange videos of things that happen on live tv, and this week it was no different - a person seems to disappear in thin air. A glitch in the matrix or not ? Let’s take a look&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When going to the woods my favorite thing to do is relaxing with friends or family and having a good time. However things don’t always go like this. A man was using his ATV in the woods when he came across a mysterious creature, a mysterious , creepy and weird creature that looked like the Sasquatch.  Did they really have a strange encounter or was it something else ? This and much more in this strange compilation ! Welcome to the Impossible Channel where James LaFleur analyzes the scariest , strangest and creepiest videos for your entertainment. I upload 2 to 3 times a week so sit tight and enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;💻 - If you wanna send me videos, pics or stories email me at thatimpossiblechannel@gmail.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Credits :&lt;br /&gt;CO.AG - &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://bit.ly/3fxBGD5&quot;&gt;https://bit.ly/3fxBGD5&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REPULSIVE - &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsRbuU_ffaJuxagEGpXfNkg&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsRbuU_ffaJuxagEGpXfNkg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n", "thumbnailUrl": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y5teB9Xh7SA/hqdefault.jpg", "uploadDate": "2021-09-30T03:16:01Z", "duration": "PT23M52S", "contentUrl": "https://desatelbu.github.io/videos/watch/extremely-strange-videos-you-won-t-be-able", "interactionCount": "203312" }

But the world isn’t just made out of beautiful and astonishing things. There are mysterious and dark things that sometimes we have little to no explanation. And this is sort of what happened a couple a weeks ago when someone noticed a strange object hovering a mountain. What could it be ?<br /><br /><br />Nowadays almost eveyone has a phone, but a phone isn’t just a phone - it’s a multitask operational equipment with many functions one of them being taking pictures and capturing videos. The thing is just in 2016 two hundred million people went to the movies in the cinema. That’s a lot of people isn’t it ? And if you consider that most of these people have a phone someone might have captured something strange in the cinema , right ? Well , someone actually did. In Cinemex a couple were having a discussion when all of a sudden the girl with him seems to shift into someone else. What just happened here ? This scary even was caught on camera by most people there and by security cameras. <br /><br /><br />Sandstorms aren’t strange at all, however when they happen at places they shouldn’t and never did - then things get strange. This is exactly what a couple of friends caught on tape when they were fishing at a lake when all of a sudden they spotted what they thought was a storm. It wasn’t , it was a sandstorm - something they had never seen in their lives and now they have to escape…<br /><br /><br />Flying humanoids and witches are known in certain cultures , and in certain places they are adored and worshiped. But there’s not enough proof of their existence - a couple of weeks ago a few people saw the unthinkable and the most unusual thing ever - what appears to be a flying walking person in the sky. They were able to capture it on camera and I’ll analyze closely to see if this could actually be a flying humanoid or if it’s something else.<br /><br /><br />Subscribers always send me strange videos of things that happen on live tv, and this week it was no different - a person seems to disappear in thin air. A glitch in the matrix or not ? Let’s take a look<br /><br /><br />When going to the woods my favorite thing to do is relaxing with friends or family and having a good time. However things don’t always go like this. A man was using his ATV in the woods when he came across a mysterious creature, a mysterious , creepy and weird creature that looked like the Sasquatch.  Did they really have a strange encounter or was it something else ? This and much more in this strange compilation ! Welcome to the Impossible Channel where James LaFleur analyzes the scariest , strangest and creepiest videos for your entertainment. I upload 2 to 3 times a week so sit tight and enjoy.<br /><br /><br /><br />💻 - If you wanna send me videos, pics or stories email me at thatimpossiblechannel@gmail.com<br /><br /><br />Credits :<br />CO.AG - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3fxBGD5">https://bit.ly/3fxBGD5</a> <br /><br />REPULSIVE - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsRbuU_ffaJuxagEGpXfNkg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsRbuU_ffaJuxagEGpXfNkg</a></p>
