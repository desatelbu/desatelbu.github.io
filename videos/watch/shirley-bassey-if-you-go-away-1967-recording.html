        { "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Shirley Bassey - IF You Go Away (1967 Recording)", "description": "&lt;p&gt;1967 - Shirley Bassey recorded and release this song, ‘If You Go Away’ on her 1967 LP titled, ‘And We Were Lovers’.   Rod McKuen, who wrote the English Lyrics for this song, said he was very fond of Shirley’s version of this song.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ABOUT this song:&lt;br /&gt;&quot;If You Go Away&quot; is an adaptation of the 1959 Jacques Brel song &quot;Ne me quitte pas&quot; with English lyrics by Rod McKuen. Created as part of a larger project to translate Brel’s work, &quot;If You Go Away&quot; is considered a pop standard and has been recorded by many artists, including Greta Keller, for whom some say McKuen wrote the lyrics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Damita Jo reached #10 on the Adult Contemporary chart and #68 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1966 for her version of the song. Terry Jacks recorded a version of the song which was released as a single in 1974 and reached #29 on the Adult Contemporary chart, #68 on the Billboard Hot 100, and went to #8 in the UK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The complex melody is partly derivative of classical music - the poignant &quot;But if you stay…&quot; passage comes from Franz Liszt’s Hungarian Rhapsody No. 6.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sad but hopeful ballad, the lyrics are told from the perspective of someone telling their lover how much they’d be missed if they left. This is described in vivid, hyperbolic terms, such as &quot;there’ll be nothing left in the world to trust&quot;. If the lover stays, the narrator promises them both devotion and good times (&quot;I’ll make you a day / Like no day has been, or will be again&quot;). Some lines show that the narrator is speaking to the lover as they are already leaving, or considering doing so (&quot;Can I tell you now, as you turn to go…&quot;). The lines &quot;If you go, as I know you will&quot; and later &quot;…as I know you must&quot; make clear that despite the narrator’s protests, the lover’s leaving is inevitable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;McKuen’s translation is significantly different from the original Brel lyric. The English version is based around contrasting what would happen &quot;if you go away&quot; and what could happen &quot;if you stay&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the original French version, the singer begs for his lover not to leave him and is more supplicant and almost self-humiliating (the title &quot;Ne me quitte pas&quot; translates &quot;Do not leave me&quot;). Significant is the last image of the French version; although the McKuen version has lyrics that come close to the original sentiment, the French lyrics are far bleaker (as is the song in general): &quot;Let me become the shadow of your shadow, the shadow of your hand, the shadow of your dog&quot; (lit. translation of the original) as opposed to &quot;I’d have been the shadow of your shadow if I thought it might have kept me by your side&quot; (English lyrics).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LYRICS:&lt;br /&gt;If you go away, on this summer day&lt;br /&gt; Then you might as well take the sun away&lt;br /&gt; All the birds that flew in the summer sky&lt;br /&gt; When our love was new and our hearts were high&lt;br /&gt; When the day was young and the night was long&lt;br /&gt; And the moon stood still for the night birds’ song&lt;br /&gt; If you go away, if you go away, if you go away&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But if you stay, I’ll make you a day&lt;br /&gt; Like no day has been or will be again&lt;br /&gt; We’ll sail the sun, we’ll ride on the rain&lt;br /&gt; We’ll talk to the trees and worship the wind&lt;br /&gt; Then if you go, I’ll understand&lt;br /&gt; Leave me just enough love to hold in my hand&lt;br /&gt; If you go away, if you go away, if you go away&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If you go away, as I know you will&lt;br /&gt; You must tell the world to stop turning till&lt;br /&gt; You return again, if you ever do&lt;br /&gt; For what good is love without loving you&lt;br /&gt; Can I tell you now as you turn to go&lt;br /&gt; I’ll be dying slowly till the next hello&lt;br /&gt; If you go away, if you go away, if you go away&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But if you stay I’ll make you a night&lt;br /&gt; Like no night has been or will be again&lt;br /&gt; I’ll sail on your smile, I’ll ride on your touch&lt;br /&gt; I’ll talk to your eyes that I love so much&lt;br /&gt; But if you go I won’t cry&lt;br /&gt; Though the good is gone from the word goodbye&lt;br /&gt; If you go away, if you go away, if you go away&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If you go away as I know you must&lt;br /&gt; There’ll be nothing left in the world to trust&lt;br /&gt; Just an empty room full of empty space&lt;br /&gt; Like the empty look I see on your face&lt;br /&gt; I’d have been the shadow of your dog&lt;br /&gt; If I thought you might have kept me by your side&lt;br /&gt; If you go away, if you go away, if you go away&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Special Thanks to Pieter and Astrid from the Shirley Bassey blog and all those who have provided wonderful pictures of Shirley!&lt;/p&gt;\n", "thumbnailUrl": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2JSi3i_1lZQ/hqdefault.jpg", "uploadDate": "2016-05-15T05:11:46Z", "duration": "PT5M3S", "contentUrl": "https://desatelbu.github.io/videos/watch/shirley-bassey-if-you-go-away-1967-recording", "interactionCount": "91603" }

                        <div class="py-1 d-md-block bwr" id="video-description"><p>1967 - Shirley Bassey recorded and release this song, ‘If You Go Away’ on her 1967 LP titled, ‘And We Were Lovers’.   Rod McKuen, who wrote the English Lyrics for this song, said he was very fond of Shirley’s version of this song.<br /><br />ABOUT this song:<br />"If You Go Away" is an adaptation of the 1959 Jacques Brel song "Ne me quitte pas" with English lyrics by Rod McKuen. Created as part of a larger project to translate Brel’s work, "If You Go Away" is considered a pop standard and has been recorded by many artists, including Greta Keller, for whom some say McKuen wrote the lyrics.<br /><br />Damita Jo reached #10 on the Adult Contemporary chart and #68 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1966 for her version of the song. Terry Jacks recorded a version of the song which was released as a single in 1974 and reached #29 on the Adult Contemporary chart, #68 on the Billboard Hot 100, and went to #8 in the UK.<br /><br />The complex melody is partly derivative of classical music - the poignant "But if you stay…" passage comes from Franz Liszt’s Hungarian Rhapsody No. 6.<br /><br />A sad but hopeful ballad, the lyrics are told from the perspective of someone telling their lover how much they’d be missed if they left. This is described in vivid, hyperbolic terms, such as "there’ll be nothing left in the world to trust". If the lover stays, the narrator promises them both devotion and good times ("I’ll make you a day / Like no day has been, or will be again"). Some lines show that the narrator is speaking to the lover as they are already leaving, or considering doing so ("Can I tell you now, as you turn to go…"). The lines "If you go, as I know you will" and later "…as I know you must" make clear that despite the narrator’s protests, the lover’s leaving is inevitable.<br /><br />McKuen’s translation is significantly different from the original Brel lyric. The English version is based around contrasting what would happen "if you go away" and what could happen "if you stay".<br /><br />In the original French version, the singer begs for his lover not to leave him and is more supplicant and almost self-humiliating (the title "Ne me quitte pas" translates "Do not leave me"). Significant is the last image of the French version; although the McKuen version has lyrics that come close to the original sentiment, the French lyrics are far bleaker (as is the song in general): "Let me become the shadow of your shadow, the shadow of your hand, the shadow of your dog" (lit. translation of the original) as opposed to "I’d have been the shadow of your shadow if I thought it might have kept me by your side" (English lyrics).<br /><br />LYRICS:<br />If you go away, on this summer day<br /> Then you might as well take the sun away<br /> All the birds that flew in the summer sky<br /> When our love was new and our hearts were high<br /> When the day was young and the night was long<br /> And the moon stood still for the night birds’ song<br /> If you go away, if you go away, if you go away<br /><br /> But if you stay, I’ll make you a day<br /> Like no day has been or will be again<br /> We’ll sail the sun, we’ll ride on the rain<br /> We’ll talk to the trees and worship the wind<br /> Then if you go, I’ll understand<br /> Leave me just enough love to hold in my hand<br /> If you go away, if you go away, if you go away<br /><br /> If you go away, as I know you will<br /> You must tell the world to stop turning till<br /> You return again, if you ever do<br /> For what good is love without loving you<br /> Can I tell you now as you turn to go<br /> I’ll be dying slowly till the next hello<br /> If you go away, if you go away, if you go away<br /><br /> But if you stay I’ll make you a night<br /> Like no night has been or will be again<br /> I’ll sail on your smile, I’ll ride on your touch<br /> I’ll talk to your eyes that I love so much<br /> But if you go I won’t cry<br /> Though the good is gone from the word goodbye<br /> If you go away, if you go away, if you go away<br /><br /> If you go away as I know you must<br /> There’ll be nothing left in the world to trust<br /> Just an empty room full of empty space<br /> Like the empty look I see on your face<br /> I’d have been the shadow of your dog<br /> If I thought you might have kept me by your side<br /> If you go away, if you go away, if you go away<br /><br />Special Thanks to Pieter and Astrid from the Shirley Bassey blog and all those who have provided wonderful pictures of Shirley!</p>
