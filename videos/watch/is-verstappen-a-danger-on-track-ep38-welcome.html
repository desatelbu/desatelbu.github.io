Tiff Needell and Paul Woodman bring us the latest roundup of motorsport events from around the World! In this episode, we look at Formula 2, Aussie Supercars and S5000 Single seaters, but we kick off with the Formula 1 race in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Potentially the most insane race we’ve ever seen in Formula 1, would you agree? An incredible drive from both Lewis Hamilton in his Mercedes, and Max Verstappen in his Red Bull as the battle continues for the Championship!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The opening corner at Jeddah caused a few problems, Tiff did call it last week! Verstappen had an amazing qualifying, although only qualified in 3rd place after not completing his lap. In the race, Mick Schumacher crashed in his Haas car, resulting in a red flag for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following the restart, Verstappen gained advantage through overtaking Hamilton and then coming off the track, leaving Hamilton to take avoiding action and allowing Esteban Ocon to move into 2nd place. The stewards intervened at this point,  Red Bull the option to take 3rd place behind Ocon and Hamilton, or face a penalty. Red Bull chose to put Max into 3rd place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then we had a 2nd red flag caused by Nikita Mazepin and Sergio Perez, resulting in both drivers being retired from the race. Verstappen came back to overtake Hamilton and Ocon, resulting in his team asking him to give the place back to Hamilton. This however turned into Hamilton crashing into the back of Verstappen! A crazy turn of events! Thankfully, the front wing of Hamilton’s car had minimal damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After further trading positions between Hamilton and Verstappen, Verstappen received a 5 second penalty from the stewards, awarding Hamilton the win. Verstappen took 2nd place, with Bottas just sneaking past Ocon on the final straight to snatch 3rd place. Verstappen then left the podium without celebrating. Onto Abu Dhabi for a very exciting season finale!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Staying in Saudi Arabia, Formula 2 brought a lot of excitement too! Oscar Piastri edges closer to his championship victory following his fourth win of the season in the second sprint race. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following a red flag in F2, Theo Pourchaire’s car stalled on the grid, and Enzo Fittipaldi hit the back of his car, resulting in both drivers being taken to hospital. We have since heard that both drivers are ok. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feature race was then shortened to 20 minutes, and was cut even shorter when the race was declared over following a second red flag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving down-under to Australia, where the Aussie Supercars were at Mount Panorama Motor Racing Circuit , Bathurst, NSW. It was a win for Chaz Mostert, in his Holden Commodore ZB, with Cameron Waters in his Ford Mustang in 2nd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next weekend, we have the Formula 1 final coming in Abu Dhabi and we see the battle for the championship win between Lewis and Max! Who will win?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chapters:&lt;br /&gt;00:00 - Intro&lt;br /&gt;00:41 - Saudi Arabia F1&lt;br /&gt;19:56 - Formula 2&lt;br /&gt;24:15 - Aussie Supercars&lt;br /&gt;26:01 - Next Week&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where to listen: &lt;br /&gt;Lovecars: &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://lovecars.com/podcasts&quot;&gt;https://lovecars.com/podcasts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spotify: &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/show/4yTA0SRKquw4WkShhMNjoL&quot;&gt;https://open.spotify.com/show/4yTA0SRKquw4WkShhMNjoL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apple: &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/lovecars-on-the-grid-global-motorsport-podcast/id1560811646?uo=4&quot;&gt;https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/lovecars-on-the-grid-global-motorsport-podcast/id1560811646?uo=4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Google: &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy81NDZkZDUwNC9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw==&quot;&gt;https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy81NDZkZDUwNC9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw==&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;–&lt;br /&gt;You can support the channel over on our Patreon page - &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/lovecarsTV​&quot;&gt;https://www.patreon.com/lovecarsTV​&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow the guys:&lt;br /&gt;Tiff:  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://instagram.com/tiff_needell&quot;&gt;https://instagram.com/tiff_needell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul:  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://instagram.com/pww&quot;&gt;https://instagram.com/pww&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep up to date: &lt;br /&gt;YouTube: &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://youtube.com/lovecarsTV&quot;&gt;https://youtube.com/lovecarsTV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Facebook: &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://facebook.com/lovecars&quot;&gt;https://facebook.com/lovecars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instagram: &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://instagram.com/lovecars&quot;&gt;https://instagram.com/lovecars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twitter: &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lovecars&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/lovecars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n", "thumbnailUrl": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BHdCONQep4k/hqdefault.jpg", "uploadDate": "2021-12-06T19:00:06Z", "duration": "PT30M3S", "contentUrl": "https://desatelbu.github.io/videos/watch/is-verstappen-a-danger-on-track-ep38-welcome", "interactionCount": "71574" }

                        <div class="py-1 d-md-block bwr" id="video-description"><p>Welcome to episode 38 of the Lovecars On The Grid Podcast! Tiff Needell and Paul Woodman bring us the latest roundup of motorsport events from around the World! In this episode, we look at Formula 2, Aussie Supercars and S5000 Single seaters, but we kick off with the Formula 1 race in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia!<br /><br />Potentially the most insane race we’ve ever seen in Formula 1, would you agree? An incredible drive from both Lewis Hamilton in his Mercedes, and Max Verstappen in his Red Bull as the battle continues for the Championship!<br /><br />The opening corner at Jeddah caused a few problems, Tiff did call it last week! Verstappen had an amazing qualifying, although only qualified in 3rd place after not completing his lap. In the race, Mick Schumacher crashed in his Haas car, resulting in a red flag for the first time.<br /><br />Following the restart, Verstappen gained advantage through overtaking Hamilton and then coming off the track, leaving Hamilton to take avoiding action and allowing Esteban Ocon to move into 2nd place. The stewards intervened at this point,  Red Bull the option to take 3rd place behind Ocon and Hamilton, or face a penalty. Red Bull chose to put Max into 3rd place.<br /><br />Then we had a 2nd red flag caused by Nikita Mazepin and Sergio Perez, resulting in both drivers being retired from the race. Verstappen came back to overtake Hamilton and Ocon, resulting in his team asking him to give the place back to Hamilton. This however turned into Hamilton crashing into the back of Verstappen! A crazy turn of events! Thankfully, the front wing of Hamilton’s car had minimal damage.<br /><br />After further trading positions between Hamilton and Verstappen, Verstappen received a 5 second penalty from the stewards, awarding Hamilton the win. Verstappen took 2nd place, with Bottas just sneaking past Ocon on the final straight to snatch 3rd place. Verstappen then left the podium without celebrating. Onto Abu Dhabi for a very exciting season finale!<br /><br />Staying in Saudi Arabia, Formula 2 brought a lot of excitement too! Oscar Piastri edges closer to his championship victory following his fourth win of the season in the second sprint race. <br /><br />Following a red flag in F2, Theo Pourchaire’s car stalled on the grid, and Enzo Fittipaldi hit the back of his car, resulting in both drivers being taken to hospital. We have since heard that both drivers are ok. <br /><br />The feature race was then shortened to 20 minutes, and was cut even shorter when the race was declared over following a second red flag.<br /><br />Moving down-under to Australia, where the Aussie Supercars were at Mount Panorama Motor Racing Circuit , Bathurst, NSW. It was a win for Chaz Mostert, in his Holden Commodore ZB, with Cameron Waters in his Ford Mustang in 2nd.<br /><br />Next weekend, we have the Formula 1 final coming in Abu Dhabi and we see the battle for the championship win between Lewis and Max! Who will win?<br /><br />Chapters:<br />00:00 - Intro<br />00:41 - Saudi Arabia F1<br />19:56 - Formula 2<br />24:15 - Aussie Supercars<br />26:01 - Next Week<br /><br />Where to listen: <br />Lovecars: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://lovecars.com/podcasts">https://lovecars.com/podcasts</a><br />Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/show/4yTA0SRKquw4WkShhMNjoL">https://open.spotify.com/show/4yTA0SRKquw4WkShhMNjoL</a><br />Apple: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/lovecars-on-the-grid-global-motorsport-podcast/id1560811646?uo=4">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/lovecars-on-the-grid-global-motorsport-podcast/id1560811646?uo=4</a><br />Google: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy81NDZkZDUwNC9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw==">https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy81NDZkZDUwNC9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw==</a><br />–<br />You can support the channel over on our Patreon page - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/lovecarsTV​">https://www.patreon.com/lovecarsTV​</a> <br /><br />Follow the guys:<br />Tiff:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/tiff_needell">https://instagram.com/tiff_needell</a><br />Paul:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/pww">https://instagram.com/pww</a><br /><br />Keep up to date: <br />YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/lovecarsTV">https://youtube.com/lovecarsTV</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/lovecars">https://facebook.com/lovecars</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/lovecars">https://instagram.com/lovecars</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/lovecars">https://twitter.com/lovecars</a></p>
