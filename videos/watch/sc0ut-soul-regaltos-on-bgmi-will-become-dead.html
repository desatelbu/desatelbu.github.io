There is no extensive development in the game mechanics. Everything is still working the same as it used to a year ago with minor changes.&lt;br /&gt; Incorrect matching of the lobbies has made the game very boring.&lt;br /&gt;Players can’t use “Classic Matches” to practice the game anymore. They will either get killed by hackers, or they’ll have to kill a lot of Bots &amp;amp; low-tiered players.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Classic games having players from Ace to Platinum tiers make the game unsuitable for both the high and low tier players. They can’t have fun playing the game, and they can’t learn anything either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Players used to play PUBG Mobile (now BGMI) for one main reason- to have fun. But now, the hackers, cheaters, bots, and incorrectly matched lobbies have made it boring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Krafton still has enough time to revive the game before it is too late. They can work on an effective Anti-cheat &amp;amp; cheat-detection system that is actually able to counter hackers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They should also focus on paying attention to the player’s feedback, and understand what the players want. Else, only the E-Sports section of the game will be left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some serious developments are much needed in the game. Or else, BGMI will soon become a game long-forgotten, especially with the rapid development in the Mobile Gaming Industry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, in recent stream of @sc0ut , him and @SOUL Regaltos talk about @BATTLEGROUNDS MOBILE INDIA will become dead game soon .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;@Krutika Plays Youtube channel is back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PUBG developers Krafton are gearing up for the launch of a new game. PUBG New State will release later this year in select markets worldwide. The upcoming battle royale is rumoured to release in India in November. Tipsters Yogesh and GadgetsData claim that Krafton will release the PUBG Mobile sequel in India on November 11. Alongside, the game is also said to release globally on the same date. While Krafton is yet to announce the official launch date at the time of writing this, supporting the leaked date is a video. The video uploaded by Twitter account @PUBGNewStateNS reveals some clips of the upcoming trailer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A part of the PUBG New State trailer, which was leaked by @PUBGNewStateNS, reveals snippets of the Troi map. It also confirms that Erangel will be among the first set of maps available for players in the new battle royale. At about 17 seconds in the video, the trailer reveals the global launch date of PUBG New State. While Krafton has not yet announced the date, the video suggests that the game will be available globally on November 11, 2021. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The game will be available on both iOS and Android. However, Krafton could release the game first on Android, followed by its release on iOS. This is purely based on the rollout of BGMI, which was launched earlier this year in India. There is no official word regarding the rollout date at the moment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Krafton has, however, officially teased the new Troi map. It is an 8×8 map with locations like Mall, Police Station, Tram Factory, Exhibition Hall, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My second channel - &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCewBZNMJOn7bnhFsHH4CShA&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCewBZNMJOn7bnhFsHH4CShA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sponsored By - &lt;br /&gt;Extra0rdinnary is sponsored by GemWire - &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/gemwire.gg/&quot;&gt;https://www.instagram.com/gemwire.gg/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BECOME CHANNEL MEMBERS - &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJLFsRmpJtYMvEjoxgl0fEw/join&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJLFsRmpJtYMvEjoxgl0fEw/join&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contact And Follow me on -   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow me on Instagram  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/extra_0rdinnary/&quot;&gt;https://www.instagram.com/extra_0rdinnary/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow me on Facebook  - &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/Extraordinary997&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/Extraordinary997&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow me on Twitter - &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/EoOfficial99&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/EoOfficial99&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My DISCORD - &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://discord.gg/X8fFZYg&quot;&gt;https://discord.gg/X8fFZYg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You Can Send Me News on Instagram. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About My channel -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extra0rdinnary is an esports and gaming news platform that puts a focus on pro players, teams, creators, and the games that make it all possible. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER -&lt;br /&gt;If you need a song removed on my channel, please message me on Instagram . &lt;br /&gt;© Copyright: We / I do not own any of the material in this video.&lt;br /&gt;I upload videos for promotional and preview purposes only!&lt;br /&gt;If you are the Producer or Photographer and would like the Video taken down please Email me and we / I shall remove it immediately.&lt;br /&gt;Please do not issue a &quot;Copyright Strike&quot; against the Channel as it affects all previous work.

                        <div class="py-1 d-md-block bwr" id="video-description"><p>@BATTLEGROUNDS MOBILE INDIA  has also become very boring now. There is no extensive development in the game mechanics. Everything is still working the same as it used to a year ago with minor changes.<br /> Incorrect matching of the lobbies has made the game very boring.<br />Players can’t use “Classic Matches” to practice the game anymore. They will either get killed by hackers, or they’ll have to kill a lot of Bots &amp; low-tiered players.<br /><br />Classic games having players from Ace to Platinum tiers make the game unsuitable for both the high and low tier players. They can’t have fun playing the game, and they can’t learn anything either.<br /><br />Players used to play PUBG Mobile (now BGMI) for one main reason- to have fun. But now, the hackers, cheaters, bots, and incorrectly matched lobbies have made it boring.<br /><br />Krafton still has enough time to revive the game before it is too late. They can work on an effective Anti-cheat &amp; cheat-detection system that is actually able to counter hackers.<br /><br />They should also focus on paying attention to the player’s feedback, and understand what the players want. Else, only the E-Sports section of the game will be left.<br /><br />Some serious developments are much needed in the game. Or else, BGMI will soon become a game long-forgotten, especially with the rapid development in the Mobile Gaming Industry.<br /><br />Also, in recent stream of @sc0ut , him and @SOUL Regaltos talk about @BATTLEGROUNDS MOBILE INDIA will become dead game soon .<br /><br />@Krutika Plays Youtube channel is back.<br /><br />PUBG developers Krafton are gearing up for the launch of a new game. PUBG New State will release later this year in select markets worldwide. The upcoming battle royale is rumoured to release in India in November. Tipsters Yogesh and GadgetsData claim that Krafton will release the PUBG Mobile sequel in India on November 11. Alongside, the game is also said to release globally on the same date. While Krafton is yet to announce the official launch date at the time of writing this, supporting the leaked date is a video. The video uploaded by Twitter account @PUBGNewStateNS reveals some clips of the upcoming trailer.<br /><br />A part of the PUBG New State trailer, which was leaked by @PUBGNewStateNS, reveals snippets of the Troi map. It also confirms that Erangel will be among the first set of maps available for players in the new battle royale. At about 17 seconds in the video, the trailer reveals the global launch date of PUBG New State. While Krafton has not yet announced the date, the video suggests that the game will be available globally on November 11, 2021. <br /><br />The game will be available on both iOS and Android. However, Krafton could release the game first on Android, followed by its release on iOS. This is purely based on the rollout of BGMI, which was launched earlier this year in India. There is no official word regarding the rollout date at the moment. <br /><br />Krafton has, however, officially teased the new Troi map. It is an 8×8 map with locations like Mall, Police Station, Tram Factory, Exhibition Hall, etc.<br /><br /><br />My second channel - <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCewBZNMJOn7bnhFsHH4CShA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCewBZNMJOn7bnhFsHH4CShA</a><br /><br />Sponsored By - <br />Extra0rdinnary is sponsored by GemWire - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/gemwire.gg/">https://www.instagram.com/gemwire.gg/</a><br /><br />BECOME CHANNEL MEMBERS - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJLFsRmpJtYMvEjoxgl0fEw/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJLFsRmpJtYMvEjoxgl0fEw/join</a><br /><br />Contact And Follow me on -   <br /><br />Follow me on Instagram  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/extra_0rdinnary/">https://www.instagram.com/extra_0rdinnary/</a><br />Follow me on Facebook  - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Extraordinary997">https://www.facebook.com/Extraordinary997</a><br />Follow me on Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/EoOfficial99">https://twitter.com/EoOfficial99</a><br />My DISCORD - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/X8fFZYg">https://discord.gg/X8fFZYg</a><br />You Can Send Me News on Instagram. <br /><br />About My channel -<br /><br />Extra0rdinnary is an esports and gaming news platform that puts a focus on pro players, teams, creators, and the games that make it all possible. <br /><br />DISCLAIMER -<br />If you need a song removed on my channel, please message me on Instagram . <br />© Copyright: We / I do not own any of the material in this video.<br />I upload videos for promotional and preview purposes only!<br />If you are the Producer or Photographer and would like the Video taken down please Email me and we / I shall remove it immediately.<br />Please do not issue a "Copyright Strike" against the Channel as it affects all previous work.
