The result was just this: they found that investing $1 in the market, increases the aggregate market value by $5…not 1 CENT, like the average person thought. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The purpose was to help explain stock market volatility, find the root cause of rising prices, and estimate the impact of Fed Money Printing within the economy…and, when we have a ratio of 5-to-1…that means that, while companies have a record amount of cash on the sidelines…the stock market could continue going much, much higher. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, nobody can predict what’s going to unfold in the short term…and, ANYTHING could happen…but, still…study after study continues to show the same thing: if you have cash, it’s better to invest all of it immediately, than wait to invest….75% of the time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for myself…I’ve employed a little bit of a hybrid approach, where - I keep some cash on the sidelines as my “opportunity” fund in case a good investment comes up…but, with everything else… every single day…without fail…I invest a consistent amount in the market, and that’s it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, like I mentioned…statistically..it does seem like, the more likely investors are worried about a crash…the less likely there is a crash…unless, by doing the opposite…we actually wind up seeing a crash…because, we didn’t think there would be one, because people thought one would happen…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/shop/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB&quot;&gt;https://www.amazon.com/shop/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For business or one-on-one real estate investing/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

The result was just this: they found that investing $1 in the market, increases the aggregate market value by $5…not 1 CENT, like the average person thought. <br /><br />The purpose was to help explain stock market volatility, find the root cause of rising prices, and estimate the impact of Fed Money Printing within the economy…and, when we have a ratio of 5-to-1…that means that, while companies have a record amount of cash on the sidelines…the stock market could continue going much, much higher. <br /><br />Obviously, nobody can predict what’s going to unfold in the short term…and, ANYTHING could happen…but, still…study after study continues to show the same thing: if you have cash, it’s better to invest all of it immediately, than wait to invest….75% of the time. <br /><br />As for myself…I’ve employed a little bit of a hybrid approach, where - I keep some cash on the sidelines as my “opportunity” fund in case a good investment comes up…but, with everything else… every single day…without fail…I invest a consistent amount in the market, and that’s it. <br /><br />But, like I mentioned…statistically..it does seem like, the more likely investors are worried about a crash…the less likely there is a crash…unless, by doing the opposite…we actually wind up seeing a crash…because, we didn’t think there would be one, because people thought one would happen…<br /><br />My ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB">https://www.amazon.com/shop/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB</a><br /><br />For business or one-on-one real estate investing/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com<br /><br /><em>Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.
