Still, with her scandals piling up, these celebrities have exposed the comedian’s true character on social media. With jokes that are taken too far, they’re done putting up with the Ellen DeGeneres, so let’s see what they have to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mariah Carey&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2008, Mariah Carey was still trying to keep her early pregnancy a secret from the public. Still, it seems like Ellen had other plans for the announcement. While appearing on the show, Ellen tried to ask the singer whether or not she was pregnant casually. When Mariah dodged the question, Ellen brought out a bottle of champagne to quote &quot;celebrate her not being pregnant,&quot; and since Mariah didn’t want to spill the beans just yet, and took a small sip of the drink. The comedian then announces with this that the singer was pregnant, constantly yelling it on the interview. Mariah opens up in an interview with Vulture that she was indeed pregnant at that time and said she &quot;didn’t enjoy that moment&quot; and adds that &quot;there is an empathy that can be applied to those moments that I would have liked to have been implemented.&quot; Not long after the interview, Mariah Carrey and Nick Cannon suffered from a miscarriage, and they had to announce it to the public, the very situation the ex-couple wanted to avoid. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brad Garrett&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The famous star of &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot; has appeared six times on the show, which would make us think that he and Ellen would be friends. But when news of Ellen’s toxic workplace etiquette reported by her own employees surfaced in the media, he said nothing to help the comedian. Instead, he confirms these rumors with a tweet saying, &quot;Sorry but it comes from the top @TheEllenShow, know more than one who were treated horribly by her. Common Knowledge&quot;. People were quick to cover the newly obtained testimony from the actor and posted the article on Twitter which actress Lea Thompson further confirmed with her prompt reply, &quot;True story. It is.&quot;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Justin Bieber&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems like Ellen has a knack to put even famous singers in an uncomfortable position. For her very first show of the Christmas season, Ellen decided to invite Justin Bieber to the show, and the usual intentional awkward questions started. While the singer answered the questions with finesse, dodging the questions one by one, it was clear how tense and stiff he was throughout the show, avoiding her eyes and constantly sipping on his water. Ellen continued to bombard Justin with uncomfortable questions regarding his wife, like &quot;What are you all waiting for? You know you love kids. You’re so good with kids. What’s the holdup?&quot;, and she even questioned Hailey’s culinary skills. But that wasn’t all. In two other interviews with Justin, she flashed a leaked nude photo taken by the paparazzi. She questioned, &quot;Who was the girl at the back?, and she even boldly asked about Justin’s sex life with Hailey Bieber. And in both interviews, it was very clear that Justin wanted to bolt out of the set and be as far away as he could from Ellen.&lt;/p&gt;\n", "thumbnailUrl": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bwjpS9BkXd0/hqdefault.jpg", "uploadDate": "2021-10-03T15:12:35Z", "duration": "PT8M43S", "contentUrl": "https://desatelbu.github.io/videos/watch/celebs-speak-out-on-how-they-were-treated", "interactionCount": "1674" }

Still, with her scandals piling up, these celebrities have exposed the comedian’s true character on social media. With jokes that are taken too far, they’re done putting up with the Ellen DeGeneres, so let’s see what they have to say.<br /><br /><br />Mariah Carey<br /><br />In 2008, Mariah Carey was still trying to keep her early pregnancy a secret from the public. Still, it seems like Ellen had other plans for the announcement. While appearing on the show, Ellen tried to ask the singer whether or not she was pregnant casually. When Mariah dodged the question, Ellen brought out a bottle of champagne to quote "celebrate her not being pregnant," and since Mariah didn’t want to spill the beans just yet, and took a small sip of the drink. The comedian then announces with this that the singer was pregnant, constantly yelling it on the interview. Mariah opens up in an interview with Vulture that she was indeed pregnant at that time and said she "didn’t enjoy that moment" and adds that "there is an empathy that can be applied to those moments that I would have liked to have been implemented." Not long after the interview, Mariah Carrey and Nick Cannon suffered from a miscarriage, and they had to announce it to the public, the very situation the ex-couple wanted to avoid. <br /><br /><br />Brad Garrett<br /><br />The famous star of "Everybody Loves Raymond" has appeared six times on the show, which would make us think that he and Ellen would be friends. But when news of Ellen’s toxic workplace etiquette reported by her own employees surfaced in the media, he said nothing to help the comedian. Instead, he confirms these rumors with a tweet saying, "Sorry but it comes from the top @TheEllenShow, know more than one who were treated horribly by her. Common Knowledge". People were quick to cover the newly obtained testimony from the actor and posted the article on Twitter which actress Lea Thompson further confirmed with her prompt reply, "True story. It is.". <br /><br /><br />Justin Bieber<br /><br />It seems like Ellen has a knack to put even famous singers in an uncomfortable position. For her very first show of the Christmas season, Ellen decided to invite Justin Bieber to the show, and the usual intentional awkward questions started. While the singer answered the questions with finesse, dodging the questions one by one, it was clear how tense and stiff he was throughout the show, avoiding her eyes and constantly sipping on his water. Ellen continued to bombard Justin with uncomfortable questions regarding his wife, like "What are you all waiting for? You know you love kids. You’re so good with kids. What’s the holdup?", and she even questioned Hailey’s culinary skills. But that wasn’t all. In two other interviews with Justin, she flashed a leaked nude photo taken by the paparazzi. She questioned, "Who was the girl at the back?, and she even boldly asked about Justin’s sex life with Hailey Bieber. And in both interviews, it was very clear that Justin wanted to bolt out of the set and be as far away as he could from Ellen.</p>
