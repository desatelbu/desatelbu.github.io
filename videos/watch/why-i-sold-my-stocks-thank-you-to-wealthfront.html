ORDINARILY, if you were to sell that first stock for a $10,000 profit - you would have to pay taxes on that profit, which could be anywhere from 10-50%, depending on your tax bracket. BUT…according to the IRS, you can OFFSET that profit by selling ANOTHER stock at a loss….and if you structure it correctly, that loss would ENTIRELY wipe out the tax you would pay on that gain. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IN ADDITION TO THAT, if your capital losses exceed your total profit, that remaining amount can be deducted off your earned income, up to $3000 per year, and any amount ABOVE that can be carried forward into future years. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, a few points you must know: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-WASH SALE&lt;br /&gt;This is when you sell a stock for a loss, use that loss to offset your tax, and then IMMEDIATELY go in and buy the exact same stock YOU JUST SOLD within a 30-days window. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-TYPE OF GAIN&lt;br /&gt;If you have a SHORT TERM LOSS On a stock you held for less than a year…that “tax deduction” will FIRST be applied to all the PROFITS you made from stocks you held for less than a year….and then, anything remaining will offset your LONG TERM CAPITAL GAINS. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-CANNOT OFFSET DIVIDENDS&lt;br /&gt;This is treated differently, so losses won’t offset this income. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/shop/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB&quot;&gt;https://www.amazon.com/shop/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For business or one-on-one real estate investing/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Graham Stephan receives cash compensation from Wealthfront Advisers LLC (“Wealthfront Advisers”) for sponsored advertising materials.

ORDINARILY, if you were to sell that first stock for a $10,000 profit - you would have to pay taxes on that profit, which could be anywhere from 10-50%, depending on your tax bracket. BUT…according to the IRS, you can OFFSET that profit by selling ANOTHER stock at a loss….and if you structure it correctly, that loss would ENTIRELY wipe out the tax you would pay on that gain. <br /><br />IN ADDITION TO THAT, if your capital losses exceed your total profit, that remaining amount can be deducted off your earned income, up to $3000 per year, and any amount ABOVE that can be carried forward into future years. <br /><br />HOWEVER, a few points you must know: <br /><br />-WASH SALE<br />This is when you sell a stock for a loss, use that loss to offset your tax, and then IMMEDIATELY go in and buy the exact same stock YOU JUST SOLD within a 30-days window. <br /><br />-TYPE OF GAIN<br />If you have a SHORT TERM LOSS On a stock you held for less than a year…that “tax deduction” will FIRST be applied to all the PROFITS you made from stocks you held for less than a year….and then, anything remaining will offset your LONG TERM CAPITAL GAINS. <br /><br />-CANNOT OFFSET DIVIDENDS<br />This is treated differently, so losses won’t offset this income. <br /><br />My ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB">https://www.amazon.com/shop/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB</a><br /><br />For business or one-on-one real estate investing/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com<br /><br /><br />Graham Stephan receives cash compensation from Wealthfront Advisers LLC (“Wealthfront Advisers”) for sponsored advertising materials.
