Jobs that will disappear in the due to AI and robots.  Artificial Intelligence and Robots are already replacing so many jobs. Do you wonder which jobs are likely to get automated? Which jobs will be taken over by artificial intelligence? Here I discuss 7 jobs without future, I also give out jobs categories which are not be replaced by robots soon, jobs and careers of future.These are the jobs which have a very high probability of becoming fully automated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First Job category would be all the Drivers: taxi, bus, train, truck drivers and even pilots! Driverless cars or buses might once have been the domain of science fiction but nowadays companies such as Waymo already have green light to test fully driverless vehicles and they are already being brought to the market. Self-driving truck company Otto has successfully tested such trucks. The same goes for plane pilots.&lt;br /&gt;#2 category and we enter a completely different area: Stock Traders&lt;br /&gt;A study made by Bloomberg analysts a few years ago discovered that less than 10% of the stocks that are traded on daily basis, worldwide, are traded by actual humans and investors. The rest, by BOTS! And Google’s new quantum computers are more sophisticated than anyone expected, they detect patterns in a series of seemingly random numbers. They could perform thousands of trade operations in a microsecond.&lt;br /&gt;#3 Telemarketing industry has been taken over by targeted ads all around the Internet, on all of our devices. &lt;br /&gt;#4. Bank employees. Just recently Deutsche Bank confirmed that they are already replacing 18,000 workers with Robots. All financial operations, like opening an account, transferring money, etc. can be easily done online from your home or anywhere else. Many local bank branches have already closed, still the banks won’t disappear. People will still need to consult with financial advisors and experts, so a certain amount of banks has to remain open. In any case a mid-level bank employees are a significantly reduced profession…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now let’s go through a few jobs that that won’t disappear:&lt;br /&gt;Since people are living longer each year, all the medical careers, like doctors, nurses, dentists, child care staff, etc. will have even more work. The jobs which are creative, like architects, photographers, designers, content creators will continue to be needed. &lt;br /&gt;The same goes to real sales people, since automated bots can hardly replace a face to face connection. The jobs which require emotional intelligence and interpersonal/social skills simply cannot be programmed into a robot. That’s why it also applies to teachers and professors. Despite a lot of information available on the internet and how technology has evolved, to help in instructor-less learning, sharing the human experience will always be required in a classroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am Marat from Emmotion, myemmotion.com, Recruitment and Career Services Agency, look me up on LinkedIn.

Jobs that will disappear in the due to AI and robots.  Artificial Intelligence and Robots are already replacing so many jobs. Do you wonder which jobs are likely to get automated? Which jobs will be taken over by artificial intelligence? Here I discuss 7 jobs without future, I also give out jobs categories which are not be replaced by robots soon, jobs and careers of future.These are the jobs which have a very high probability of becoming fully automated.<br /><br />First Job category would be all the Drivers: taxi, bus, train, truck drivers and even pilots!

Bank employees. Just recently Deutsche Bank confirmed that they are already replacing 18,000 workers with Robots. All financial operations, like opening an account, transferring money, etc. can be easily done online from your home or anywhere else. Many local bank branches have already closed, still the banks won’t disappear. People will still need to consult with financial advisors and experts, so a certain amount of banks has to remain open. In any case a mid-level bank employees are a significantly reduced profession…<br /><br />Now let’s go through a few jobs that that won’t disappear:<br />Since people are living longer each year, all the medical careers, like doctors, nurses, dentists, child care staff, etc. will have even more work. The jobs which are creative, like architects, photographers, designers, content creators will continue to be needed. <br />The same goes to real sales people, since automated bots can hardly replace a face to face connection. The jobs which require emotional intelligence and interpersonal/social skills simply cannot be programmed into a robot. That’s why it also applies to teachers and professors. Despite a lot of information available on the internet and how technology has evolved, to help in instructor-less learning, sharing the human experience will always be required in a classroom.<br /><br />I am Marat from Emmotion, myemmotion.com, Recruitment and Career Services Agency, look me up on LinkedIn.
