It has more than 400 functions, among which are to help digest food, store energy and eliminate toxins. For this reason, it is important to take care of it through good lifestyle habits.&lt;br /&gt;As its name implies, fatty liver disease is a condition in which fat accumulates in this organ. Although there are certain causes why this problem develops, the exact reason some people tend to accumulate fat in the liver is unknown, and others do not. There is also a limited understanding of why some fatty livers develop inflammation that can progress to cirrhosis.&lt;br /&gt;One of the recommendations by specialists when treating this disease is to improve diet and lose weight. In this way, fat, inflammation, and fibrosis in the liver can be reduced.&lt;br /&gt;According to Medline Plus experts, &quot;there are no drugs that have been approved to treat the problem.&quot; Researchers continue to study whether a certain diabetes drug or vitamin E can help but have yet to conclude.&lt;br /&gt;It is important to bear in mind that a healthy lifestyle and, above all, a good diet can significantly help maintain the vital organ’s well-being. For this, it is always possible to have the advice of a doctor or nutritionist.&lt;br /&gt;More about fatty liver:&lt;br /&gt;Once the fatty liver disease has developed, it is essential to follow the doctor’s guidelines according to the type of liver disorder. There are two main types:&lt;br /&gt;• Non-alcoholic fatty liver.&lt;br /&gt;• Alcoholic fatty liver. Which is also called alcoholic hepatic steatosis. &lt;br /&gt;The main symptoms usually generate inflammation and fatigue. The patient may experience general discomfort so that the treatment usually requires a lifestyle change.&lt;br /&gt;In long-term complications, the problem can lead to cirrhosis of the liver or other similar diseases.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended fruits to treat fatty liver:&lt;br /&gt;A balanced diet is essential for health in every way. For this reason, experts and institutions around the world, including the World Health Organization, emphasize the importance of its proper maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;Next we will focus on fruits, which although it may not seem like it, are an excellent alternative for the day-to-day compared to industrial edibles and many others that, far from providing essential nutrients to the body, only provide sugar, fats and excessive amounts of Salt.&lt;br /&gt;Now let’s See The List of Fruits:&lt;br /&gt;Apple:&lt;br /&gt;Professionals usually recommend the daily consumption of at least one green apple. This fruit can help reduce blood sugar levels. Also, this is a fruit that can help cleanse the liver.&lt;br /&gt;According to some hypotheses, it must be taken into account that apples have malic acid, which prevents the appearance of stones in the liver and kidneys.&lt;br /&gt;Last but not least, it should be known that the skin of this fruit is very beneficial. This provides more minerals capable of attacking fat and eliminating heavy metals from the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Citrus:&lt;br /&gt;Citrus fruits are considered to help cleanse the liver and strengthen the immune system thanks to their antioxidant properties and is one of the best sources of vitamin C.&lt;br /&gt;There is a wide variety of juices in which the bitter, bitter taste of citrus fruits such as lemon can be disguised, so that it can be consumed without problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grapefruit:&lt;br /&gt;According to the current detox, the grapefruit comprises enzymes that stimulate the liver, which can help remove fats and toxins. It is also a source of malic acid and carotenoids, two elements that strengthen and contribute to the maintenance of the organ. Likewise, it is worth mentioning its high content of naringenin, which allows us to break down the fatty acids accumulated in the liver and expel them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avocado:&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that the virtues of avocado lie in oleic acid, a type of monounsaturated fatty acid with many properties. This type of acid helps lower cholesterol levels. We must also remember that it has fiber, which helps satisfy the appetite and reduces glucose in the blood.&lt;br /&gt;All this can help us daily to maintain adequate nutrition with which to take care of the body and the liver. In this way, harmful cells that are stored in the organ can be gradually eliminated, optimizing its essential functions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MEDICAL DISCLAIMER &lt;br /&gt;This channel (TimePass Machi) are continuously changing practices.

There are two main types:<br />• Non-alcoholic fatty liver.<br />• Alcoholic fatty liver. Which is also called alcoholic hepatic steatosis. <br />The main symptoms usually generate inflammation and fatigue. The patient may experience general discomfort so that the treatment usually requires a lifestyle change.<br />In long-term complications, the problem can lead to cirrhosis of the liver or other similar diseases.<br />Recommended fruits to treat fatty liver:<br />A balanced diet is essential for health in every way. For this reason, experts and institutions around the world, including the World Health Organization, emphasize the importance of its proper maintenance.<br />Next we will focus on fruits, which although it may not seem like it, are an excellent alternative for the day-to-day compared to industrial edibles and many others that, far from providing essential nutrients to the body, only provide sugar, fats and excessive amounts of Salt.<br />Now let’s See The List of Fruits:<br />Apple:<br />Professionals usually recommend the daily consumption of at least one green apple. This fruit can help reduce blood sugar levels. Also, this is a fruit that can help cleanse the liver.<br />According to some hypotheses, it must be taken into account that apples have malic acid, which prevents the appearance of stones in the liver and kidneys.<br />Last but not least, it should be known that the skin of this fruit is very beneficial. This provides more minerals capable of attacking fat and eliminating heavy metals from the body.<br /><br />Citrus:<br />Citrus fruits are considered to help cleanse the liver and strengthen the immune system thanks to their antioxidant properties and is one of the best sources of vitamin C.<br />There is a wide variety of juices in which the bitter, bitter taste of citrus fruits such as lemon can be disguised, so that it can be consumed without problem.<br /><br />Grapefruit:<br />According to the current detox, the grapefruit comprises enzymes that stimulate the liver, which can help remove fats and toxins. It is also a source of malic acid and carotenoids, two elements that strengthen and contribute to the maintenance of the organ. Likewise, it is worth mentioning its high content of naringenin, which allows us to break down the fatty acids accumulated in the liver and expel them.<br /><br />Avocado:<br />Keep in mind that the virtues of avocado lie in oleic acid, a type of monounsaturated fatty acid with many properties. This type of acid helps lower cholesterol levels. We must also remember that it has fiber, which helps satisfy the appetite and reduces glucose in the blood.<br />All this can help us daily to maintain adequate nutrition with which to take care of the body and the liver. In this way, harmful cells that are stored in the organ can be gradually eliminated, optimizing its essential functions.<br /><br />MEDICAL DISCLAIMER <br />This channel (TimePass Machi) are continuously changing practices.
