Gantry had been the frontman of Elmer Gantry’s Velvet Opera. Kirby had been a member of Curved Air. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The band was put together in 1974 with help from Fleetwood Mac manager Clifford Davis and drummer Mick Fleetwood to perform as Fleetwood Mac on a US tour because the existing Fleetwood Mac were not in a position to fulfil outstanding contractual obligations. &lt;br /&gt;However, Fleetwood did not join the tour as planned, and later denied any knowledge or involvement, and partway through the tour it became obvious to audiences that there was no original member of Fleetwood Mac in the band, and the tour collapsed. Bass player Paul Martinez claimed, &quot;Mick Fleetwood pulled out at the last minute claiming not to know who we were!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stretch rose from the ashes of this debacle, and soon had a No. 16 hit single in November 1975 with &quot;Why Did You Do It?” the lyric of which was a direct attack on Mick Fleetwood for his failure to join the band on the ill-fated US tour. &lt;br /&gt;In the official video for the record bass player Paul Martinez wore a traditional keffiyeh head-dress. Besides bass player Martinez, guitarist Kirby and Jim Russell on drums and tambourine, the single featured electric guitar by Hiroshi Kato and horns by Bud Beadle, Chris Mercer, Mick Eve, Mike Bailey and Ron Carthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Toppop video was recorded on 13 February 1976&lt;br /&gt;The single reached to no. 6 in the Dutch Top 40 in March 1976.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch our great music videos ❯ &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://goo.gl/feVLNN&quot;&gt;https://goo.gl/feVLNN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More TopPop?
