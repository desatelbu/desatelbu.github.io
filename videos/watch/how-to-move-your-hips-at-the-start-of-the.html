This video is for all golfers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your interested lessons then please visit the website &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.russellheritagegolf.com&quot;&gt;https://www.russellheritagegolf.com&lt;/a&gt; Online lessons are also now available and more information will be on my website soon but for now please contact me via my social media pages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also golf school dates have been allocated to the website which can be found on the website &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.russellheritagegolf.com&quot;&gt;https://www.russellheritagegolf.com&lt;/a&gt; too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m setting up a social forum where golfers can help each other and i’ll be there to help too if your interested in this then follow me on the links below and i’ll post more details. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://facebook.com/AshesGolf/&quot;&gt;https://facebook.com/AshesGolf/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/russellheritagegolf/?hl=en&quot;&gt;https://www.instagram.com/russellheritagegolf/?hl=en&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ProRussgolf&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/ProRussgolf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This channel focuses on the golf swing and discussing in detail about the areas of the golf swing that most amateurs get wrong. Each how to video explains everything a golfer needs to know so they can improve their golf game and start lowering their scores, so whether your trying to break 100, break 90, break 80 or break 70 then this channel will help you achieve everything you want. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don’t rely on many if any training aids with my coaching as I believe that the change will happen once you understand what it is your really trying to do with your golf swing and once your understanding improves then you will start to make the correct swing change, I will occasionally offer drills to do as this can often improve your feel versus perception battle and help aid your cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only training aids I suggest are useful is the Gforce golf training aids link can be found below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.gforcegolf.com?rfsn=2247591.d32d8&amp;amp;utm_source=refersion&amp;amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;amp;utm_campaign=2247591.d32d8&quot;&gt;http://www.gforcegolf.com?rfsn=2247591.d32d8&amp;amp;utm_source=refersion&amp;amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;amp;utm_campaign=2247591.d32d8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The left wrist aid &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://300yardimpact.com?aff=10&quot;&gt;https://300yardimpact.com?aff=10&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the Speed swing trainer too if your interested follow the link below and use code &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.swingspeedgolf.com/?product=swing-speed-golf-training-kit&quot;&gt;https://www.swingspeedgolf.com/?product=swing-speed-golf-training-kit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ssgrussell10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love giving golf tips however I really enjoy helping golfers with their game and love the positive feedback about golfers who I have helped with their ball striking or driving or whatever so if you like golf tips then you should subscribe. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ll always try to put my swing on slow motion on the camera however this is sometimes difficult due to the set up of my driving range and I’m often looking for privacy but I agree that seeing a Professional swing in slow motion can help golfers develop. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do use the term perfect golf swing, not because there is a perfect golf swing or perfect backswing etc however I like to discuss options in all my videos and strongly believe there are 5 or 6 things we have to do in the golf swing but there are options for golfers to choose what they want to do which is why I feel im qualified to discuss the perfect golf swing as much as anybody else. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The areas I disucss in the golf swing are hip rotation, swing plane, upper body movements, how to gain speed in your golf swing, how to use the driver, all golf swing basics, golf swing for seniors, golf swing for irons, the elbow positions and whats the best way to swing a golf club and much more. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also do a lot of club reviews with Midlands Golf and specially Ronnie and coach at Four Ashes and a friend who helps me as I’m not the most technical person when it comes to club equipment, but we talk about what are the best golf clubs, golf bags, golf balls and even golf trolleys. Everyone wants to know whats the best golf club and especially the best driver which is why we test all of the clubs and give our opinion on what the best golf clubs are. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We talk about the popular tournaments upcoming especially the masters as this is a favourite for every golfer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We do all of this from our happy home Four Ashes Golf Centre. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if your keen on learning the best way to swing a golf club, the best latest golf wedge, or interested in online golf lessons, what have Taylormade golf launched now?, or is the latest Callaway driver acyually longer than the prevoius model?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then press that subscribe buttion, ring those bells and join me on my journey into golf and who knowas where we’ll end up.&lt;/p&gt;\n", "thumbnailUrl": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/87D94EDMOkc/hqdefault.jpg", "uploadDate": "2020-04-15T20:30:01Z", "duration": "PT8M44S", "contentUrl": "https://desatelbu.github.io/videos/watch/how-to-move-your-hips-at-the-start-of-the", "interactionCount": "51765" }

                        <div class="py-1 d-md-block bwr" id="video-description"><p>You are currently watching a video about how to move your hips at the start of the downswing. This video is for all golfers. <br /><br />If your interested lessons then please visit the website <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.russellheritagegolf.com">https://www.russellheritagegolf.com</a> Online lessons are also now available and more information will be on my website soon but for now please contact me via my social media pages.<br /><br />Also golf school dates have been allocated to the website which can be found on the website <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.russellheritagegolf.com">https://www.russellheritagegolf.com</a> too.<br /><br />I’m setting up a social forum where golfers can help each other and i’ll be there to help too if your interested in this then follow me on the links below and i’ll post more details. <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/AshesGolf/">https://facebook.com/AshesGolf/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/russellheritagegolf/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/russellheritagegolf/?hl=en</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/ProRussgolf">https://twitter.com/ProRussgolf</a><br /><br />This channel focuses on the golf swing and discussing in detail about the areas of the golf swing that most amateurs get wrong. Each how to video explains everything a golfer needs to know so they can improve their golf game and start lowering their scores, so whether your trying to break 100, break 90, break 80 or break 70 then this channel will help you achieve everything you want. <br /><br />I don’t rely on many if any training aids with my coaching as I believe that the change will happen once you understand what it is your really trying to do with your golf swing and once your understanding improves then you will start to make the correct swing change, I will occasionally offer drills to do as this can often improve your feel versus perception battle and help aid your cause.<br /><br />The only training aids I suggest are useful is the Gforce golf training aids link can be found below:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.gforcegolf.com?rfsn=2247591.d32d8&amp;utm_source=refersion&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=2247591.d32d8">http://www.gforcegolf.com?rfsn=2247591.d32d8&amp;utm_source=refersion&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=2247591.d32d8</a><br /><br />The left wrist aid <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://300yardimpact.com?aff=10">https://300yardimpact.com?aff=10</a> <br /><br />I like the Speed swing trainer too if your interested follow the link below and use code <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.swingspeedgolf.com/?product=swing-speed-golf-training-kit">https://www.swingspeedgolf.com/?product=swing-speed-golf-training-kit</a><br /><br />ssgrussell10<br /><br /><br /><br />I love giving golf tips however I really enjoy helping golfers with their game and love the positive feedback about golfers who I have helped with their ball striking or driving or whatever so if you like golf tips then you should subscribe. <br /><br />I’ll always try to put my swing on slow motion on the camera however this is sometimes difficult due to the set up of my driving range and I’m often looking for privacy but I agree that seeing a Professional swing in slow motion can help golfers develop. <br /><br />I do use the term perfect golf swing, not because there is a perfect golf swing or perfect backswing etc however I like to discuss options in all my videos and strongly believe there are 5 or 6 things we have to do in the golf swing but there are options for golfers to choose what they want to do which is why I feel im qualified to discuss the perfect golf swing as much as anybody else. <br /><br />The areas I disucss in the golf swing are hip rotation, swing plane, upper body movements, how to gain speed in your golf swing, how to use the driver, all golf swing basics, golf swing for seniors, golf swing for irons, the elbow positions and whats the best way to swing a golf club and much more. <br /><br />I also do a lot of club reviews with Midlands Golf and specially Ronnie and coach at Four Ashes and a friend who helps me as I’m not the most technical person when it comes to club equipment, but we talk about what are the best golf clubs, golf bags, golf balls and even golf trolleys. Everyone wants to know whats the best golf club and especially the best driver which is why we test all of the clubs and give our opinion on what the best golf clubs are. <br /><br />We talk about the popular tournaments upcoming especially the masters as this is a favourite for every golfer.<br /><br />We do all of this from our happy home Four Ashes Golf Centre. <br /><br />So if your keen on learning the best way to swing a golf club, the best latest golf wedge, or interested in online golf lessons, what have Taylormade golf launched now?, or is the latest Callaway driver acyually longer than the prevoius model?<br /><br />Then press that subscribe buttion, ring those bells and join me on my journey into golf and who knowas where we’ll end up.</p>
