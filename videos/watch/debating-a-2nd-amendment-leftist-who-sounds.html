The only thing I do disagree with you guys on is, you guys were kind of talking or touching on it a little bit ago, but I do feel like as leftists we should not be pushing for more regulations on the individual as far as gun ownership and be a little bit more on the side of individual rights and systematic regulation. So I’m wondering what you would say on that part because I do think it’s a little bit maybe hypocritical of us to try to say we want less regulation on the bodily autonomy of a woman I mean obviously I hate drawing that line but you guys were talking about that as well but also trying to you know play that game of saying individual rights for a woman but now individual rights for a constitutional right, so I guess that’s my point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sam Seder: First off it is not a question of an individual right it is this is not a right it is denying certain sovereignty to women as opposed to men or anyone else is the issue right? It’s denying a certain right to people who have the ability to gestate essentially, that’s the issue I don’t think there is a constitutional right for people to carry a weapon in this country,  the supreme court disagrees. Their ruling carries more sway than mine in that regard but it’s not a question of defending you know just generically the notion of individual rights. It’s also a question of like what is in the best interest of society and people and in my mind, it is in the best interest of the portion of the massive portion of people in our society who can get pregnant to have the ability to decide that they don’t want to be forced to carry that pregnancy to term. I think it is in the best interest of our society to not have people walking around with weapons&lt;/p&gt;\n", "thumbnailUrl": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rp0iiOIQook/hqdefault.jpg", "uploadDate": "2021-10-07T03:00:30Z", "duration": "PT16M56S", "contentUrl": "https://desatelbu.github.io/videos/watch/debating-a-2nd-amendment-leftist-who-sounds", "interactionCount": "19460" }

The only thing I do disagree with you guys on is, you guys were kind of talking or touching on it a little bit ago, but I do feel like as leftists we should not be pushing for more regulations on the individual as far as gun ownership and be a little bit more on the side of individual rights and systematic regulation. So I’m wondering what you would say on that part because I do think it’s a little bit maybe hypocritical of us to try to say we want less regulation on the bodily autonomy of a woman I mean obviously I hate drawing that line but you guys were talking about that as well but also trying to you know play that game of saying individual rights for a woman but now individual rights for a constitutional right, so I guess that’s my point.<br /><br />Sam Seder: First off it is not a question of an individual right it is this is not a right it is denying certain sovereignty to women as opposed to men or anyone else is the issue right? It’s denying a certain right to people who have the ability to gestate essentially, that’s the issue I don’t think there is a constitutional right for people to carry a weapon in this country,  the supreme court disagrees. Their ruling carries more sway than mine in that regard but it’s not a question of defending you know just generically the notion of individual rights. It’s also a question of like what is in the best interest of society and people and in my mind, it is in the best interest of the portion of the massive portion of people in our society who can get pregnant to have the ability to decide that they don’t want to be forced to carry that pregnancy to term. I think it is in the best interest of our society to not have people walking around with weapons</p>
