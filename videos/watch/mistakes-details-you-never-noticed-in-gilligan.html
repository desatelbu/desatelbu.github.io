Some of those things are mistakes made during filming, like visible backdrops behind the set or prop people being visible in scenes.&lt;br /&gt;There are also goofs that would have made it hard to pinpoint exactly where Gilligan’s Island was for anyone searching for the castaways. For example, two different coordinates were given for the island in different episodes. And the Professor wasn’t very clear in one of them, making their chances of rescue a lot less likely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were also a lot of little details that would be easy to miss on casual viewing. For example, the first episode included a scene with actors from the original pilot that wasn’t in the show when it officially premiered. And while several of the characters were known by one name or their nickname, like Gilligan and the Skipper, some of those names were mentioned briefly in the first episode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this video, we’ll look at some of the biggest goofs that happened over the three seasons of Gilligan’s Island as well as a bunch of small details that most people probably never noticed. Next time you watch the show, you’ll have something new to watch for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We post new videos regularly so be sure to like and subscribe to the Facts Verse channel to be sure you don’t miss any of our upcoming topics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mistakes &amp;amp; Details You Never Noticed in Gilligan’s Island&lt;/p&gt;\n", "thumbnailUrl": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VmtSp2ZR_cc/hqdefault.jpg", "uploadDate": "2021-10-11T23:00:11Z", "duration": "PT8M2S", "contentUrl": "https://desatelbu.github.io/videos/watch/mistakes-details-you-never-noticed-in-gilligan", "interactionCount": "2518" }

                        <div class="py-1 d-md-block bwr" id="video-description"><p>Gilligan’s Island debuted in September 1964 and ran for three seasons, through April 1967. In the years since it went off the air, it’s been running in syndication almost non-stop. With it being on TV so much, it’s generated several generations of fans who know the show inside and out.<br /><br />▬Contents of this video▬<br />00:00 - Intro<br />00:28 - Minor Goofs You’ve Probably Never Noticed<br />00:36 - Two on a Raft<br />00:55 - So Sorry, My Island Now <br />01:33 - They’re Off and Running<br />01:48 - The Friendly Physician<br />02:01 - Pass the Vegetables, Please<br />02:16 - Man With a Net<br />02:35 - Personal Magnetism<br />02:49 - The Missing Eighth Castaway<br />03:17 - The Skipper’s Name<br />03:30 - Ginger Slept in the Nude<br />03:53 - Ginger Seemingly Made Her Own Dress On the Island<br />04:14 - The Set from Gunsmoke<br />04:32 - The Island Has Two Sets of Coordinates<br />05:15 - The Voice of Bugs Bunny Makes an Appearance<br />05:36 - The Theme Song’s Famous Composer<br />05:54 - The Lagoon Was Awfully Close to a Busy Highway<br />06:12 - Mary Ann and the Professor Were Initially Considered Extras<br />06:41 - Gilligan’s Full Name<br />07:09 - Outro<br /><br />Like this content?

Some of those things are mistakes made during filming, like visible backdrops behind the set or prop people being visible in scenes.<br />There are also goofs that would have made it hard to pinpoint exactly where Gilligan’s Island was for anyone searching for the castaways. For example, two different coordinates were given for the island in different episodes. And the Professor wasn’t very clear in one of them, making their chances of rescue a lot less likely.<br /><br />There were also a lot of little details that would be easy to miss on casual viewing. For example, the first episode included a scene with actors from the original pilot that wasn’t in the show when it officially premiered. And while several of the characters were known by one name or their nickname, like Gilligan and the Skipper, some of those names were mentioned briefly in the first episode.<br /><br />In this video, we’ll look at some of the biggest goofs that happened over the three seasons of Gilligan’s Island as well as a bunch of small details that most people probably never noticed. Next time you watch the show, you’ll have something new to watch for!<br /><br />We post new videos regularly so be sure to like and subscribe to the Facts Verse channel to be sure you don’t miss any of our upcoming topics.<br /><br />Mistakes &amp; Details You Never Noticed in Gilligan’s Island</p>
