I mean, he stays pretty calm and collected in situations that would have made any person explode. Not to mention how his members love teasing each other so you can only imagine the amount of patience he has to endure it.&lt;br /&gt;However, RM can also be intimidating at times since let’s be honest, he can get angry as well but in the case of RM, he can get pretty angry when he reached his limits.&lt;br /&gt;I mean, super angry and while I admit he looks hot while being so, NAMJOON losing his cool is the last thing we want to see since he’s scary. Like super scary.&lt;br /&gt;I know you guys want to see these moments so don’t worry because I prepared a list just for you.&lt;br /&gt;Let’s get started.&lt;br /&gt;Being a leader means RM has to handle most of the questions thrown at them. This is very true when the boys would promote in the US since he’s very much fluent in English and while the members are slowly but surely learning the language, RM is still their designated translator until they are fully confident to speak.&lt;br /&gt;Well, because of this, RM has a few shares of hair-grabbing moments because the questions thrown at them range from absurd to straight-up nonsense.&lt;br /&gt;For example, the boys were once asked whether Big Hit entertainment was preparing to debut what the report called as quote the ‘next BTS’.&lt;br /&gt;While the other members were looking rather uncomfortable and just all in all over these kinds of questions, RM was silently taking notes however the look on his face tells an entirely different story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;👍🏼 We really appreciate if you want to like this video&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;🌎 Here on Kpop Army we just love Kpop and we want to spread the positive and inspiring message of Kpop all over the world!
