Blakely is when the prosecution wants an enhanced (greater) sentence than the normal sentencing guidelines.&lt;br /&gt;There are TWO Blakely factors submitted by the state:&lt;br /&gt;1- Defendant posed greater than normal dangers to other people as she fired into the vehicle&lt;br /&gt;2 - Potter abused her position of authority as a license police officer in full uniform.&lt;br /&gt;State says defense agreed to have a &quot;unitary&quot; trial, meaning the jury would also hear about the Blakely factors.   Defense said they never agreed to that and they want a &quot;bifurcated&quot; trial.  Judge grants that.  This means:&lt;br /&gt;Bifurcated means to separate this issue from the guilt phase and the JUDGE will decide on the Blakely factors when/if there is a conviction and will solely be up to a judge to determine if the sentence will be enhanced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MOTIONS:&lt;br /&gt;Potter prosecutors filed two motions today after the problematic testimony from Mychal Johnson on Friday.&lt;br /&gt;1 - Motion to keep defense from eliciting expert testimony from non-experts. (remember Johnson testified deadly force would have been justified)&lt;br /&gt;2- Motion to permit State to elicit testimony related to union membership (Potter was Union president at one time) for the purpose of establishing possible bias in various law enforcement witnesses&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charges: Note: Both prosecutors and defense agree the shooting was an accident but prosecutors say her actions were criminally negligent.&lt;br /&gt;* First-degree manslaughter (added in Sept.) - “recklessly” used a firearm - causing Wright’s death. - Up to 15 yrs in prison - In Minnesota, a person can be convicted of first-degree manslaughter if they cause the death of another while also committing a misdemeanor — in this case, reckless handling of a firearm. &lt;br /&gt;* Second-degree manslaughter - requires that prosecutors prove only that the defendant acted with &quot;culpable negligence&quot; as the defendant consciously took actions that created an &quot;unreasonable risk&quot; of causing death or great bodily harm.  - Up to 10 yrs in prison&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Former police officer Kimberly Ann Potter, 49, stands trial for killing Daunte Wright, 20, in a disastrous traffic stop. Potter’s attorney has also said that she will testify. You can watch jury selection in the player above. Opening statements are scheduled for Wednesday, Dec. 8.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no dispute that Potter fired her gun. The question is whether Potter’s actions constitute first and second-degree manslaughter under Minnesota law.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As seen on body cam video from April 11, 2021, officers with the Brooklyn Center Public Department pulled over Wright for a traffic stop. Officer Anthony Luckey began to handcuff him against the driver’s side of the car. He suggested Wright was about to resist.&lt;br /&gt;#DaunteWright #KimPotter&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;READ THE FULL STORY HERE:&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://lawandcrime.com/live-trials/live-trials-current/kim-potter/watch-live-former-cop-kim-potter-jury-selection-in-daunte-wright-death/&quot;&gt;https://lawandcrime.com/live-trials/live-trials-current/kim-potter/watch-live-former-cop-kim-potter-jury-selection-in-daunte-wright-death/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch Law&amp;amp;Crime Network NOW  on YouTubeTV!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://tv.youtube.com/welcome/?utm_servlet=prod&amp;amp;zipcode=99202&quot;&gt;https://tv.youtube.com/welcome/?utm_servlet=prod&amp;amp;zipcode=99202&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OTHER WAYS TO WATCH LAW&amp;amp;CRIME NETWORK IN YOUR AREA:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://lawandcrime.com/where-to-watch/&quot;&gt;https://lawandcrime.com/where-to-watch/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;READ MORE GREAT ARTICLES FROM LAW&amp;amp;CRIME NETWORK HERE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://lawandcrime.com&quot;&gt;https://lawandcrime.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUBSCRIBE TO ALL OF Law&amp;amp;Crime Network YouTube Channels:&lt;br /&gt;Main Channel: &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz8K1occVvDTYDfFo7N5EZw&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz8K1occVvDTYDfFo7N5EZw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Channel B: &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVXOqoOCYbi-iXChKAl6DTQ&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVXOqoOCYbi-iXChKAl6DTQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Channel C: &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXCLaaClAWQiTkl3pw9ZdLw&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXCLaaClAWQiTkl3pw9ZdLw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Channel D &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMV3pzWIhJGLYzoHyxBjjNw&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMV3pzWIhJGLYzoHyxBjjNw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who To Follow On Twitter:&lt;br /&gt;@LawCrimeNetwork&lt;br /&gt;@LawCrimeVerdict&lt;br /&gt;@Cathy Russon &lt;br /&gt;@AddiTrialsStuff&lt;/p&gt;\n", "thumbnailUrl": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UKSC0UqAbCU/hqdefault.jpg", "uploadDate": "2021-12-20T14:36:36Z", "duration": "P0D", "contentUrl": "https://desatelbu.github.io/videos/watch/watch-live-mn-v-kim-potter-trial-day-9-jury", "interactionCount": "45519" }

Blakely is when the prosecution wants an enhanced (greater) sentence than the normal sentencing guidelines.<br />There are TWO Blakely factors submitted by the state:<br />1- Defendant posed greater than normal dangers to other people as she fired into the vehicle<br />2 - Potter abused her position of authority as a license police officer in full uniform.<br />State says defense agreed to have a "unitary" trial, meaning the jury would also hear about the Blakely factors.   Defense said they never agreed to that and they want a "bifurcated" trial.  Judge grants that.  This means:<br />Bifurcated means to separate this issue from the guilt phase and the JUDGE will decide on the Blakely factors when/if there is a conviction and will solely be up to a judge to determine if the sentence will be enhanced.<br /><br />MOTIONS:<br />Potter prosecutors filed two motions today after the problematic testimony from Mychal Johnson on Friday.<br />1 - Motion to keep defense from eliciting expert testimony from non-experts. (remember Johnson testified deadly force would have been justified)<br />2- Motion to permit State to elicit testimony related to union membership (Potter was Union president at one time) for the purpose of establishing possible bias in various law enforcement witnesses<br /><br />Charges: Note: Both prosecutors and defense agree the shooting was an accident but prosecutors say her actions were criminally negligent.<br />* First-degree manslaughter (added in Sept.) - “recklessly” used a firearm - causing Wright’s death. - Up to 15 yrs in prison - In Minnesota, a person can be convicted of first-degree manslaughter if they cause the death of another while also committing a misdemeanor — in this case, reckless handling of a firearm. <br />* Second-degree manslaughter - requires that prosecutors prove only that the defendant acted with "culpable negligence" as the defendant consciously took actions that created an "unreasonable risk" of causing death or great bodily harm.  - Up to 10 yrs in prison<br /><br />Former police officer Kimberly Ann Potter, 49, stands trial for killing Daunte Wright, 20, in a disastrous traffic stop. Potter’s attorney has also said that she will testify. You can watch jury selection in the player above. Opening statements are scheduled for Wednesday, Dec. 8.<br /><br />There is no dispute that Potter fired her gun. The question is whether Potter’s actions constitute first and second-degree manslaughter under Minnesota law.<br /><br />As seen on body cam video from April 11, 2021, officers with the Brooklyn Center Public Department pulled over Wright for a traffic stop. Officer Anthony Luckey began to handcuff him against the driver’s side of the car. He suggested Wright was about to resist.<br />#DaunteWright #KimPotter<br /><br />READ THE FULL STORY HERE:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://lawandcrime.com/live-trials/live-trials-current/kim-potter/watch-live-former-cop-kim-potter-jury-selection-in-daunte-wright-death/">https://lawandcrime.com/live-trials/live-trials-current/kim-potter/watch-live-former-cop-kim-potter-jury-selection-in-daunte-wright-death/</a><br /><br />Watch Law&amp;Crime Network NOW  on YouTubeTV!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tv.youtube.com/welcome/?utm_servlet=prod&amp;zipcode=99202">https://tv.youtube.com/welcome/?utm_servlet=prod&amp;zipcode=99202</a><br /><br />OTHER WAYS TO WATCH LAW&amp;CRIME NETWORK IN YOUR AREA:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://lawandcrime.com/where-to-watch/">https://lawandcrime.com/where-to-watch/</a><br /><br />READ MORE GREAT ARTICLES FROM LAW&amp;CRIME NETWORK HERE:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://lawandcrime.com">https://lawandcrime.com</a><br /><br />SUBSCRIBE TO ALL OF Law&amp;Crime Network YouTube Channels:<br />Main Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz8K1occVvDTYDfFo7N5EZw">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz8K1occVvDTYDfFo7N5EZw</a><br />Channel B: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVXOqoOCYbi-iXChKAl6DTQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVXOqoOCYbi-iXChKAl6DTQ</a><br />Channel C: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXCLaaClAWQiTkl3pw9ZdLw">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXCLaaClAWQiTkl3pw9ZdLw</a><br />Channel D <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMV3pzWIhJGLYzoHyxBjjNw">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMV3pzWIhJGLYzoHyxBjjNw</a><br /><br />Who To Follow On Twitter:<br />@LawCrimeNetwork<br />@LawCrimeVerdict<br />@Cathy Russon <br />@AddiTrialsStuff</p>
