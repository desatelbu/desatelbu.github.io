        { "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "VideoObject", "name": "BREAKING NEWS: We Found 84-year-old Nadine Moses - Live Steam Update", "description": "&lt;p&gt;Today AWP began our search for 84-year-old Nadine Moses who was last seen on May 4, 2021, shortly after 5:00 a.m. in Marine City, Michigan. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her 2011 dark blue Ford Edge SUV was spotted on two surveillance cameras in Marine City. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last activity tracked on her cell phone was 5:08 a.m. in that same area of M-29 and Fairbanks Street and 4 minutes later, the phone completely went off the grid at 5:12 a.m. as though it has been submerged underwater. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AWP was first contacted by Nadine’s daughter-in-law keeping AWP updated over the past several months as the search continued. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beginning our search on the Southside of Marine City at the public boat ramp, Jared and Doug ran 2 sonar boats North towards the Belle River where they spotted a target matching the length of the missing vehicle. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After attaching a magnet to verify that it was metal, Jared dove 20’ underwater, 35-45’ from shore, and verified that the vehicle and plate matched Nadine’s missing car. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Visibility was less than 6 inches. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The family and local law enforcement were notified while AWP waited on the scene to offer their assistance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the county having a strong dive team with top-of-the-line gear, dive assistance was not necessary from AWP. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon removal of the vehicle, it was confirmed that a body was inside believed to be Nadine Moses. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A full autopsy will need to be conducted before the final confirmation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AWP met with the family shortly after today’s discovery, prior to the removal of the vehicle and body. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our thoughts and prays go out to Nadine’s family during this difficult time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will have a full edit of our search and recovery efforts available in the next few months. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hug the ones you love for you never know when it might be the last time you see them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are humbled by the opportunity all of you have given us to help in the search for answers as to what happened to Nadine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The AWP Movement would not be possible without your support, helping us travel the US offering our services for FREE to families searching for their lost loved ones… Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW IS AWP FUNDED?&lt;br /&gt;======================&lt;br /&gt;Many have been left to question how Adventures With Purpose receives its funding, who benefits, and how are the funds spent?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We answer those questions here… ➤ &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;

                        <div class="py-1 d-md-block bwr" id="video-description"><p>Today AWP began our search for 84-year-old Nadine Moses who was last seen on May 4, 2021, shortly after 5:00 a.m. in Marine City, Michigan. <br /><br />Her 2011 dark blue Ford Edge SUV was spotted on two surveillance cameras in Marine City. <br /><br />The last activity tracked on her cell phone was 5:08 a.m. in that same area of M-29 and Fairbanks Street and 4 minutes later, the phone completely went off the grid at 5:12 a.m. as though it has been submerged underwater. <br /><br />AWP was first contacted by Nadine’s daughter-in-law keeping AWP updated over the past several months as the search continued. <br /><br />Beginning our search on the Southside of Marine City at the public boat ramp, Jared and Doug ran 2 sonar boats North towards the Belle River where they spotted a target matching the length of the missing vehicle. <br /><br />After attaching a magnet to verify that it was metal, Jared dove 20’ underwater, 35-45’ from shore, and verified that the vehicle and plate matched Nadine’s missing car. <br /><br />Visibility was less than 6 inches. <br /><br />The family and local law enforcement were notified while AWP waited on the scene to offer their assistance. <br /><br />With the county having a strong dive team with top-of-the-line gear, dive assistance was not necessary from AWP. <br /><br />Upon removal of the vehicle, it was confirmed that a body was inside believed to be Nadine Moses. <br /><br />A full autopsy will need to be conducted before the final confirmation<br /><br />AWP met with the family shortly after today’s discovery, prior to the removal of the vehicle and body. <br /><br />Our thoughts and prays go out to Nadine’s family during this difficult time. <br /><br />We will have a full edit of our search and recovery efforts available in the next few months. <br /><br />Hug the ones you love for you never know when it might be the last time you see them. <br /><br />We are humbled by the opportunity all of you have given us to help in the search for answers as to what happened to Nadine.<br /><br />The AWP Movement would not be possible without your support, helping us travel the US offering our services for FREE to families searching for their lost loved ones… Thank you!<br /><br />HOW IS AWP FUNDED?<br />======================<br />Many have been left to question how Adventures With Purpose receives its funding, who benefits, and how are the funds spent?<br /><br />We answer those questions here… ➤ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/wz1dCguO2y0">https://youtu.be/wz1dCguO2y0</a><br /><br />Because of your amazing support: 12 Missing Person Cold Cases Have Been Solved since 2019, bringing resolution and answers to families looking for their lost loved ones.<br /><br />Without you being here as part of the AWP Family, we’d never be in this position to have this opportunity to travel the US, working these Cold Cases of Missing Persons, doing everything we can to help bring them home to their families. <br /><br />HOW CAN YOU HELP AWP?<br />======================<br />🎯 Subscribe Now…➤ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/SubAWP">http://bit.ly/SubAWP</a><br />👕 AWP Merch and Donations..➤ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://adventureswithpurpose.com">https://adventureswithpurpose.com</a><br />🎬 GET VIDEOS EARLY… ➤ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/AWP-Team-Member">http://bit.ly/AWP-Team-Member</a><br /><br />SUBSCRIBE TO OTHERS ON THE TEAM<br />☞ Subscribe to Jacob’s Channel..➤ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/SubChaosDivers">http://bit.ly/SubChaosDivers</a><br />☞ Subscribe to Doug..➤ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/DougBishop">http://bit.ly/DougBishop</a><br />☞ Sub to Josh..➤ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/SubJoshCantu">https://bit.ly/SubJoshCantu</a><br />☞ Carson on Instagram..➤ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/CarsonOnInstagram">https://bit.ly/CarsonOnInstagram</a><br /><br />Questions?<br />Email: support@adventureswithpurpose.com<br />==================<br /><br />🎬🍿 Watch More of Our Episodes<br /><br />SOLVED: Found Tammy Goff (Ep. 4) Missing 3-Years Underwater<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/g8TQ2aPeTco">https://youtu.be/g8TQ2aPeTco</a><br /><br />SOLVED 8-Month-Old Missing Person Case (Nicholas Allen)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/cAfYtXB-qN4">https://youtu.be/cAfYtXB-qN4</a><br /><br />SOLVED 7-Year-Old Missing Person Case..
