        { "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "VideoObject", "name": "50 SQUISHY PACKAGES?! | Unboxing Squishy Makeover Candidates", "description": "&lt;p&gt;You will never guess what someone put in a squishy package….WAIT FOR IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO YES. Today is a SUPER long squishy unboxing video because I am opening 50 packages! I know it’s a LOT and this video goes on forever. But, I hope you enjoy it. All these packages have been building up and taking over the space in my apartment. So I needed a way to get through a lot very quickly so I could start putting things away. I know I said not everyone would be featured on camera (since most of these were sent after my announcements that I have closed donations), BUT I feel bad because I know these took time, effort and money. After this batch, I am not going to push myself so hard to include every single one. These unboxings will become less frequent, since I am moving to every other Monday. I will probably only post these once every month from now on and I will have to pick and choose packages that get featured in the videos.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;____FOR THE NEW COMERS (if I didn’t already scare you away)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;__&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of months ago, I started this series called “Squishy Makeovers.” I was using ugly, cheap squishies and then painting them, adding to them and fixing them up however I saw fit. That series became a new favorite on my channel, and I decided to allow subscribers to participate by donating their own ugly, used, broken or unwanted squishies. At the time, I had a much smaller audience, but quickly my channel grew and I became overwhelmed with tons of squishy packages.  I am still working on catching up with all the packages I have received in the last few months. I have spent 4 entire videos unboxing squishy donations, and this is the biggest batch so far. Everyone comments on these videos, which squishies they want to see in the makeover videos (4 candidates), and I give the most popular requests a makeover in the next makeover video (every other Friday). These pacakages are donation only, from people who no longer want the squishies or are just interested in seeing them on camera. The squishies are not returned to the sender after the makeovers. If that doesn’t make sense, I made a video to explain. I’d appreciate if you checked it out: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKYCVbM8RU4&amp;amp;t=101s&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKYCVbM8RU4&amp;amp;t=101s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;ATTENTION&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The P.O. Box address in this video is no longer open!!! I no longer have a P.O. box in this location, so any mail sent to this address will be automatically returned to sender. Check out this video for updates:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfLxIrfLjFc&amp;amp;t=10s&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfLxIrfLjFc&amp;amp;t=10s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VIDEO FACTS:&lt;br /&gt;1. this took 4.5 hours to film the in front of the camera part, 2 hours to film all the close up shots of each package, and an hour to clean up haha&lt;br /&gt;2. I was editing this from 9am-3am Tuesday. 11am-5pm Wednesday. And then from 10am-5pm on Thursday. It was about 26 HOURS OF EDITING.&lt;br /&gt;3. This is the first time in MONTHS I have had my Friday video done before Friday! YAYYYY!&lt;br /&gt;4. Squishy Ghost makes his first visible appearance. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY CURRENT UPLOAD SCHEDULE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every Friday at 4:00pm ET: Squishy Makeovers (roughly every other Friday), Thrift Makeovers, Craft Kits and Miscellaneous crafts and DIYs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every Other Monday:  Squishy Updates, Create This Book episodes, mail openings/unboxings, announcements, experiments or any other weirdness I come up with…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHERE TO BUY MY BOOK:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2vUerfI&quot;&gt;https://amzn.to/2vUerfI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VISIT MY WEBSITE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.moriah.video/&quot;&gt;http://www.moriah.video/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INSTAGRAM: &lt;br /&gt;instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficial&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EMAIL ME PICTURES OF YOUR ART:&lt;br /&gt;Artwork@Moriah.video&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES ONLY:&lt;br /&gt;Business@Moriah.video&lt;/p&gt;\n", "thumbnailUrl": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iQolasumhRo/hqdefault.jpg", "uploadDate": "2018-08-17T20:00:05Z", "duration": "PT35M45S", "contentUrl": "https://desatelbu.github.io/videos/watch/50-squishy-packages-unboxing-squishy-makeover", "interactionCount": "14053388" }

Today is a SUPER long squishy unboxing video because I am opening 50 packages! I know it’s a LOT and this video goes on forever. But, I hope you enjoy it. All these packages have been building up and taking over the space in my apartment. So I needed a way to get through a lot very quickly so I could start putting things away. I know I said not everyone would be featured on camera (since most of these were sent after my announcements that I have closed donations), BUT I feel bad because I know these took time, effort and money. After this batch, I am not going to push myself so hard to include every single one. These unboxings will become less frequent, since I am moving to every other Monday. I will probably only post these once every month from now on and I will have to pick and choose packages that get featured in the videos.  <br /><br /><strong>____FOR THE NEW COMERS (if I didn’t already scare you away)</strong><strong>__</strong><br />A couple of months ago, I started this series called “Squishy Makeovers.” I was using ugly, cheap squishies and then painting them, adding to them and fixing them up however I saw fit. That series became a new favorite on my channel, and I decided to allow subscribers to participate by donating their own ugly, used, broken or unwanted squishies. At the time, I had a much smaller audience, but quickly my channel grew and I became overwhelmed with tons of squishy packages.  I am still working on catching up with all the packages I have received in the last few months. I have spent 4 entire videos unboxing squishy donations, and this is the biggest batch so far. Everyone comments on these videos, which squishies they want to see in the makeover videos (4 candidates), and I give the most popular requests a makeover in the next makeover video (every other Friday). These pacakages are donation only, from people who no longer want the squishies or are just interested in seeing them on camera. The squishies are not returned to the sender after the makeovers. If that doesn’t make sense, I made a video to explain. I’d appreciate if you checked it out: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKYCVbM8RU4&amp;t=101s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKYCVbM8RU4&amp;t=101s</a><br /><br /><em>ATTENTION</em><br />The P.O. Box address in this video is no longer open!!! I no longer have a P.O. box in this location, so any mail sent to this address will be automatically returned to sender.

I was editing this from 9am-3am Tuesday. 11am-5pm Wednesday. And then from 10am-5pm on Thursday. It was about 26 HOURS OF EDITING.<br />3. This is the first time in MONTHS I have had my Friday video done before Friday! YAYYYY!<br />4. Squishy Ghost makes his first visible appearance. :)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />MY CURRENT UPLOAD SCHEDULE:<br /><br />Every Friday at 4:00pm ET: Squishy Makeovers (roughly every other Friday), Thrift Makeovers, Craft Kits and Miscellaneous crafts and DIYs<br /><br />AND<br /><br />Every Other Monday:  Squishy Updates, Create This Book episodes, mail openings/unboxings, announcements, experiments or any other weirdness I come up with…<br /><br /><br />WHERE TO BUY MY BOOK:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2vUerfI">https://amzn.to/2vUerfI</a><br /><br /><br />VISIT MY WEBSITE:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.moriah.video/">http://www.moriah.video/</a><br /><br />INSTAGRAM: <br />instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficial<br /><br /><br />EMAIL ME PICTURES OF YOUR ART:<br />Artwork@Moriah.video<br /><br />FOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES ONLY:<br />Business@Moriah.video</p>
