He moved to the United States at the age of seventeen and became a mason, carpenter and farmer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mary is a Nebraska native. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Olivas moved to Wilber in 1957; many Czech immigrants lived in the town and they held a Czech Festival very year. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After his retirement, Frank continued to take odd jobs in the area. Mary appeared to be happy in Wilber and she enjoyed working in her garden and playing bingo on weekends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mary’s son by her first marriage died in 1959, and in 1960 the couple’s daughter died of polio. Only one child, their son Frank Jr., remained. Mary’s health was declining by 1973 and Shirley, Frank Jr.’s wife, came over frequently to help out around the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do you think happened to Frank and Mary?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hug the ones you love for you never know when it might be the last time you see them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are humbled by the opportunity all of you have given us to help in the search for answers as to what happened to Frank and Mary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The AWP Movement would not be possible without your support, helping us travel the US offering our services for FREE to families searching for their lost loved ones… Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;==================&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;🎬🍿 Watch More of Our Episodes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SOLVED: Found Tammy Goff (Ep. 4) Missing 3-Years Underwater&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://youtu.be/g8TQ2aPeTco&quot;&gt;https://youtu.be/g8TQ2aPeTco&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SOLVED 8-Month-Old Missing Person Case (Nicholas Allen)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://youtu.be/cAfYtXB-qN4&quot;&gt;https://youtu.be/cAfYtXB-qN4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SOLVED 7-Year-Old Missing Person Case..

He moved to the United States at the age of seventeen and became a mason, carpenter and farmer. <br /><br />Mary is a Nebraska native. <br /><br />The Olivas moved to Wilber in 1957; many Czech immigrants lived in the town and they held a Czech Festival very year. <br /><br />After his retirement, Frank continued to take odd jobs in the area. Mary appeared to be happy in Wilber and she enjoyed working in her garden and playing bingo on weekends.<br /><br />Mary’s son by her first marriage died in 1959, and in 1960 the couple’s daughter died of polio. Only one child, their son Frank Jr., remained. Mary’s health was declining by 1973 and Shirley, Frank Jr.’s wife, came over frequently to help out around the house.<br /><br />What do you think happened to Frank and Mary?<br /><br />Hug the ones you love for you never know when it might be the last time you see them. <br /><br />We are humbled by the opportunity all of you have given us to help in the search for answers as to what happened to Frank and Mary.<br /><br />The AWP Movement would not be possible without your support, helping us travel the US offering our services for FREE to families searching for their lost loved ones… Thank you!<br /><br />==================<br /><br />🎬🍿 Watch More of Our Episodes<br /><br />SOLVED: Found Tammy Goff (Ep. 4) Missing 3-Years Underwater<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/g8TQ2aPeTco">https://youtu.be/g8TQ2aPeTco</a><br /><br />SOLVED 8-Month-Old Missing Person Case (Nicholas Allen)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/cAfYtXB-qN4">https://youtu.be/cAfYtXB-qN4</a><br /><br />SOLVED 7-Year-Old Missing Person Case..
