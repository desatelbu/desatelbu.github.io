General Skilled Migration is the most popular form of migration to Australia that DOES NOT REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE AN EMPLOYER TO SPONSOR YOUR VISA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To give you a general overview of the different visas:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• The Skilled Independent Visa – Subclass 189&lt;br /&gt;This is an open Permanent visa, that does not require you to be nominated or live in any particular area in Australia. Once you get this visa can live anywhere in Australia and work in any occupation you want. However because it is such an in demand visa, it is also quite difficult to obtain. Immigration only release a certain number of these each year, and it is getting harder and harder to obtain. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To apply for this visa you must have a full skill assessment in an occupation on the immigration MLTSSL. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Skilled (State) Nominated – Subclass 190&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Skilled Nominated Visa – Subclass 190 is often referred to as the State Nominated Visa. This is a permanent visa that does not require you to have an employer to sponsor your visa. It is also points tested. However, to be able to apply for this visa you must have a state or territory nominate you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The process of applying for the state nominated visa is very similar to the skilled independent. However your occupation doesn’t need to be on the MLTSSL. It needs to be on the state occupation list. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Skilled Work Regional Visa – Subclass 491&lt;br /&gt;The Skilled Regional Visa – Subclass 491 is the final visa in the general skilled migration stream. It is initially an open 5 year work visa that leads to permanent residency. It does not require you to have an employer to sponsor your visa. It is also points tested. You can only apply for this visa to live in any city outside of Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne.&lt;br /&gt;In addition to totaling the required points, you still need to be nominated by either:&lt;br /&gt;1. a designated regional area of an Australian state or territory, OR&lt;br /&gt;2. an eligible family member residing in a designated regional area of Australia (family sponsorship is available in very limited circumstances)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;General Criteria of general skilled migration:&lt;br /&gt;• You must be under 45 years of age&lt;br /&gt;• You must have a full skill assessment in a relevant occupation (That is on the MLTSSL for 189 or state or regional lists for the 190 and 491)&lt;br /&gt;• You must have a minimum of competent English or be from a native English speaking country&lt;br /&gt;• The minimum score to submit an EOI is 65 points&lt;br /&gt;• You must meet health and character requirements. &lt;br /&gt;• Please note each state or territory has their own individual requirements for state nomination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is the process of applying:&lt;br /&gt;• Skill Assessment&lt;br /&gt;• Lodge an Expression of Interest&lt;br /&gt;• Either apply to the State or Regional Area or Some states make you wait to receive an invitation.&lt;br /&gt;• Once you are invited for the visa, you would then apply for the visa in your immi account&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you would like to chat with a registered migration agent about your options, feel free to contact Pathway to Aus and we can organise a consultation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;W: PATHWAYTOAUS.COM&lt;br /&gt;E: INFO@PATHWAYTOAUS.COM&lt;br /&gt;P: +61 7 55 265 900&lt;br /&gt;FB: FACEBOOK.COM/PATHWAYTOAUS&lt;/p&gt;\n", "thumbnailUrl": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/baqOm33wkQ8/hqdefault.jpg", "uploadDate": "2020-03-10T20:39:31Z", "duration": "PT7M35S", "contentUrl": "https://desatelbu.github.io/videos/watch/general-skilled-migration-visas-permanent", "interactionCount": "5640" }

The visas included in the General Skilled Migration are:<br /><br />• The Skilled Independent (Subclass 189)<br />• The Skilled or State Nominated (Subclass 190)<br />• The Skilled Regional (Subclass 491)<br /><br />Relevant Links:<br />✔  190 Visa - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.pathwaytoaus.com/services/visas/190">http://www.pathwaytoaus.com/services/visas/190</a><br />✔  491 Visa - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.pathwaytoaus.com/services/visas/491">http://www.pathwaytoaus.com/services/visas/491</a><br />✔ GSM Visas - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.pathwaytoaus.com/services/visas/general-skilled-migration-visa-australia/">http://www.pathwaytoaus.com/services/visas/general-skilled-migration-visa-australia/</a><br /><br />The Skilled Migration Program allows foreigners to migrate to Australia based on the occupation that they are skilled in. General Skilled Migration is the most popular form of migration to Australia that DOES NOT REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE AN EMPLOYER TO SPONSOR YOUR VISA.<br /><br />To give you a general overview of the different visas:<br /><br />• The Skilled Independent Visa – Subclass 189<br />This is an open Permanent visa, that does not require you to be nominated or live in any particular area in Australia. Once you get this visa can live anywhere in Australia and work in any occupation you want. However because it is such an in demand visa, it is also quite difficult to obtain. Immigration only release a certain number of these each year, and it is getting harder and harder to obtain. <br /><br />To apply for this visa you must have a full skill assessment in an occupation on the immigration MLTSSL. <br /><br /><br />The Skilled (State) Nominated – Subclass 190<br /><br />The Skilled Nominated Visa – Subclass 190 is often referred to as the State Nominated Visa. This is a permanent visa that does not require you to have an employer to sponsor your visa. It is also points tested. However, to be able to apply for this visa you must have a state or territory nominate you. <br /><br />The process of applying for the state nominated visa is very similar to the skilled independent. However your occupation doesn’t need to be on the MLTSSL. It needs to be on the state occupation list. <br /><br /><br />The Skilled Work Regional Visa – Subclass 491<br />The Skilled Regional Visa – Subclass 491 is the final visa in the general skilled migration stream. It is initially an open 5 year work visa that leads to permanent residency. It does not require you to have an employer to sponsor your visa. It is also points tested. You can only apply for this visa to live in any city outside of Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne.<br />In addition to totaling the required points, you still need to be nominated by either:<br />1. a designated regional area of an Australian state or territory, OR<br />2. an eligible family member residing in a designated regional area of Australia (family sponsorship is available in very limited circumstances)<br /><br />General Criteria of general skilled migration:<br />• You must be under 45 years of age<br />• You must have a full skill assessment in a relevant occupation (That is on the MLTSSL for 189 or state or regional lists for the 190 and 491)<br />• You must have a minimum of competent English or be from a native English speaking country<br />• The minimum score to submit an EOI is 65 points<br />• You must meet health and character requirements. <br />• Please note each state or territory has their own individual requirements for state nomination.<br /><br />What is the process of applying:<br />• Skill Assessment<br />• Lodge an Expression of Interest<br />• Either apply to the State or Regional Area or Some states make you wait to receive an invitation.<br />• Once you are invited for the visa, you would then apply for the visa in your immi account<br /><br />If you would like to chat with a registered migration agent about your options, feel free to contact Pathway to Aus and we can organise a consultation.<br /><br />W: PATHWAYTOAUS.COM<br />E: INFO@PATHWAYTOAUS.COM<br />P: +61 7 55 265 900<br />FB: FACEBOOK.COM/PATHWAYTOAUS</p>
