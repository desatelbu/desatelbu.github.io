If you are sensitive this podcast is not for you. But if you miss the days of comedians actually being funny instead of preaching to a quire then welcome to The Flagrancy.<br /><br />Join the Patreon Asshole Army:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2xQwHYf">http://bit.ly/2xQwHYf</a><br /><br />#Flagrant2 #AndrewSchulz #AkaashSingh #AlexxMedia<br /><br />New York native and internationally touring stand-up, Andrew Schulz is known for his hilarious and unsafe comedy.
