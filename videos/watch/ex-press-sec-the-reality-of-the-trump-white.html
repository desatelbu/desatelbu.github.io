First, Kayleigh shares what it was like to fight the liberal media every day at the White House press briefing. She discusses the tactics she devised to confront the biggest mainstream media lies and opens up about what her single most stressful moment was. Kayleigh also gives her thoughts on why Press Secretary Jen Psaki is allowed to blatantly lie to the media without being called on it. Next, Kayleigh reveals how Trump really dealt with the blatant media bias he had to deal with every day. She also reveals the only story that truly bothered him. Kayleigh discusses what it’s like to finally be on the other side of the camera working for Fox News’ Outnumbered. Kayleigh shares the irony of a viral moment she had of being questioned by Chris Cuomo and she makes her predictions on how Joe Biden’s approval rating will shape the 2024 US Election for Ron DeSantis and possibly Donald Trump. Finally, Kayleigh describes what was really going on in the White House at the very beginning of the Coronavirus pandemic. She describes why lockdowns bothered Trump so much and what Jared Kushner was most afraid of happening. She also describes what the White House Coronavirus Task Force was really like behind closed doors. She also explains her issues with Dr. Fauci and why the revelations about gain of function research have been so damning to his reputation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember when the media actually did reporting? Or a world before hot takes on social media drove everyone into a frenzy before the facts came in? You don’t need to have taken a media literacy course in college to know that the coverage of most current events these days is lacking.

                        <div class="py-1 d-md-block bwr" id="video-description"><p>Dave Rubin of “The Rubin Report” talks to former Trump White House Press Secretary and host of Fox News’ “Outnumbered” Kayleigh McEnany about why Jen Psaki doesn’t get called out for her lies, the only fake news story that got under Donald Trump’s skin, and how COVID has exposed Dr. Fauci for what he always was. First, Kayleigh shares what it was like to fight the liberal media every day at the White House press briefing. She discusses the tactics she devised to confront the biggest mainstream media lies and opens up about what her single most stressful moment was. Kayleigh also gives her thoughts on why Press Secretary Jen Psaki is allowed to blatantly lie to the media without being called on it. Next, Kayleigh reveals how Trump really dealt with the blatant media bias he had to deal with every day. She also reveals the only story that truly bothered him. Kayleigh discusses what it’s like to finally be on the other side of the camera working for Fox News’ Outnumbered. Kayleigh shares the irony of a viral moment she had of being questioned by Chris Cuomo and she makes her predictions on how Joe Biden’s approval rating will shape the 2024 US Election for Ron DeSantis and possibly Donald Trump. Finally, Kayleigh describes what was really going on in the White House at the very beginning of the Coronavirus pandemic. She describes why lockdowns bothered Trump so much and what Jared Kushner was most afraid of happening. She also describes what the White House Coronavirus Task Force was really like behind closed doors. She also explains her issues with Dr. Fauci and why the revelations about gain of function research have been so damning to his reputation.<br /><br />Remember when the media actually did reporting?
