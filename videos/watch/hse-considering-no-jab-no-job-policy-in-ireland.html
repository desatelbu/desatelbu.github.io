It’s not just the harm to themselves, but the pressure it will put on the health system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Given the transmissibility of this virus, it is more or less inevitable they will become infected given the Delta variant and the way it behaves&quot;, he says.&lt;/p&gt;\n", "thumbnailUrl": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/s7D11y0EXgQ/hqdefault.jpg", "uploadDate": "2021-10-11T17:00:33Z", "duration": "PT11M8S", "contentUrl": "https://desatelbu.github.io/videos/watch/hse-considering-no-jab-no-job-policy-in-ireland", "interactionCount": "8550" }
