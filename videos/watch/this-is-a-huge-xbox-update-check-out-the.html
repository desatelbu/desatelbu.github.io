There are rare occasions where titles rise up that can break free of this close-minded thinking, such as Overwatch, but it’s unusual to see a game nominated, let alone awarded, when there isn’t a big-budget cinematic story interwoven with the gameplay. This mentality betrays the diversity that gaming represents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there was ever a year where a racing game deserved to be nominated, 2021 was exactly it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forza Horizon 5 might not be a cinematic tear-jerker of a game, but it’s no less worthy of being nominated. This is a game that currently enjoys a position at the top of 2021’s Metacritic metascore, which averages out scores from hundreds of different review sites and YouTubers. This is a game that will probably see more players than all of the current nominations combined over the course of their lifetimes. This is a game that will touch more lives and create more friendships and relationships than all of the current nominees and is also arguably the most technically impressive game on the docket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No Elder Scrolls on PS5:&lt;br /&gt;Microsoft did allow previously announced and released titles like Deathloop, Ghostwire: Tokyo, and The Elder Scrolls Online to come out on non-Xbox consoles. But the tenor of Microsoft’s statements about future Bethesda releases began to change in March, when Microsoft confirmed that &quot;some new [Bethesda] titles in the future… will be exclusive to Xbox and PC players.&quot; By June, that set of &quot;some&quot; titles included Starfield, the highly anticipated space epic that will be exclusive to Xbox Series X/S and PC for its planned launch next year. Bethesda Senior VP of Marketing and Communications Pete Hines apologized for that state of affairs days later, saying he was &quot;certain that [exclusivity] is frustrating to folks, but there’s not a whole lot I can do about it.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Given all that, Elder Scrolls’ absence from non-Xbox consoles might not be surprising. But some fans were still holding out hope that Bethesda’s massive fantasy RPG franchise would be a Minecraft-style exception to the general rule that Microsoft-owned games only appear on Microsoft platforms. After all, Bethesda producer/director Todd Howard told GamesIndustry.biz last October that it would be &quot;hard to imagine&quot; that the next Elder Scrolls game wouldn’t be allowed on non-Xbox consoles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Design Lab Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Earlier this year we brought back Xbox Design Lab, our customization program that offers different ways to create your own personalized Xbox Wireless Controller.

There are rare occasions where titles rise up that can break free of this close-minded thinking, such as Overwatch, but it’s unusual to see a game nominated, let alone awarded, when there isn’t a big-budget cinematic story interwoven with the gameplay. This mentality betrays the diversity that gaming represents.<br /><br />If there was ever a year where a racing game deserved to be nominated, 2021 was exactly it.<br /><br />Forza Horizon 5 might not be a cinematic tear-jerker of a game, but it’s no less worthy of being nominated. This is a game that currently enjoys a position at the top of 2021’s Metacritic metascore, which averages out scores from hundreds of different review sites and YouTubers. This is a game that will probably see more players than all of the current nominations combined over the course of their lifetimes. This is a game that will touch more lives and create more friendships and relationships than all of the current nominees and is also arguably the most technically impressive game on the docket.<br /><br />No Elder Scrolls on PS5:<br />Microsoft did allow previously announced and released titles like Deathloop, Ghostwire: Tokyo, and The Elder Scrolls Online to come out on non-Xbox consoles. But the tenor of Microsoft’s statements about future Bethesda releases began to change in March, when Microsoft confirmed that "some new [Bethesda] titles in the future… will be exclusive to Xbox and PC players." By June, that set of "some" titles included Starfield, the highly anticipated space epic that will be exclusive to Xbox Series X/S and PC for its planned launch next year. Bethesda Senior VP of Marketing and Communications Pete Hines apologized for that state of affairs days later, saying he was "certain that [exclusivity] is frustrating to folks, but there’s not a whole lot I can do about it."<br />Given all that, Elder Scrolls’ absence from non-Xbox consoles might not be surprising. But some fans were still holding out hope that Bethesda’s massive fantasy RPG franchise would be a Minecraft-style exception to the general rule that Microsoft-owned games only appear on Microsoft platforms. After all, Bethesda producer/director Todd Howard told GamesIndustry.biz last October that it would be "hard to imagine" that the next Elder Scrolls game wouldn’t be allowed on non-Xbox consoles.<br /><br />Design Lab Update:<br /><br />Earlier this year we brought back Xbox Design Lab, our customization program that offers different ways to create your own personalized Xbox Wireless Controller.
