Out of all the top cryptocurrency I think the ones that will do the best will be the cryptos with use-cases and that would act as more than just a store of value. Now don’t get me wrong, I have quite a bit invested in bitcoin as a store of value but I have even more Ethereum and already am buying more on the recent dip. Now just in the past year Ethereum has tripled bitcoins gains and with all the projects and new technologies surrounding Ethereum it doesn’t look like it’s slowing down anytime soon. Now what makes Ethereum stand out (along with other similar cryptos like Solana, Polygon,) is its ability to be used alongside things like NFTs, DeFi, Web3.0 and the Metaverse. It would only make sense that if these new technologies continue to grow and scale, then so will Ethereum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My next investment after cryptocurrency is to begin creating a portfolio for the future that is the meta verse. Now what exactly will the meta verse be? Well, the honest answer is we don’t know yet. We have an idea of what it can be, but just like the internet of the early 90’s nobody could predict exactly what it turned into 30 years later. The idea of the meta verse is to create a digital universe outside of our real lives, through virtual reality, augmented reality, live in digital land and become digital avatars. Think of the movie ready player one - its a crazy idea to think about but then again so was all future technologies at some point. The idea is to understand and take advantage of these things at the ground level - so the first thing I would do is solidify my investment into the meta verse by looking at companies and stocks that will someway take part in it. Now sure you can invest in NFTs and buy digital land and things like that but those are long shots - some might put them into the speculation category - and that’s fine - but if we are talking about solid investments we might want to just start with some good ol’ solid stocks so here are a few I’m looking into..(top stocks in the video)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My next investment which is another factor in the economy that we can take advantage of and that’s rising interest rates. With inflation rising to record highs of which we haven’t seen in decades, many experts agree that the Fed will need to start raising interest rates over the next few years in efforts to lower the inflation and stabilize the economy. So what happens when interest rates increase? Consumers and business have less money to spend - which will cause demand for goods and services to decrease. So who increases the money they make during this time? Well, the ones who lend out money at a higher rate - the banks. Banks make money from the loans they provide - meanwhile paying almost nothing back to you for saving your cash - which again people will do,  so the idea is if banks will start making even more money, their stocks will be a good investment especially for 2022. (Top bank stocks in the video)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have a record low amount of inventory in the United States while real estate prices have hit record highs. Active home listing fell by 25% since 2020 and more than 40% since 2019 while the average home price hit a new all-time high of upwards of $360,000 which is up 14% since 2020 and up 30% since 2019. Almost half of the homes that go up for sale sell within 1-2 weeks and we are seeing homes sell for above asking price. So what does this all mean and how can we take advantage of the macroeconomics of the situation. Well like we spoke about before, inflation hit us in a big way this year - and even though a lot of the inflation is seen right now in consumer goods - asset prices like homes can also inflate due to the increase inflation. So I don’t think we’ll see a big decline in 2022 in home prices even if interest rates increase because of the huge demand that we are seeing for real estate.&lt;/p&gt;\n", "thumbnailUrl": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/t3pgXowBv00/hqdefault.jpg", "uploadDate": "2021-12-20T23:00:26Z", "duration": "PT14M58S", "contentUrl": "https://desatelbu.github.io/videos/watch/top-5-investments-for-2022-get-in-now-my", "interactionCount": "504" }

Out of all the top cryptocurrency I think the ones that will do the best will be the cryptos with use-cases and that would act as more than just a store of value. Now don’t get me wrong, I have quite a bit invested in bitcoin as a store of value but I have even more Ethereum and already am buying more on the recent dip. Now just in the past year Ethereum has tripled bitcoins gains and with all the projects and new technologies surrounding Ethereum it doesn’t look like it’s slowing down anytime soon. Now what makes Ethereum stand out (along with other similar cryptos like Solana, Polygon,) is its ability to be used alongside things like NFTs, DeFi, Web3.0 and the Metaverse. It would only make sense that if these new technologies continue to grow and scale, then so will Ethereum<br /><br />My next investment after cryptocurrency is to begin creating a portfolio for the future that is the meta verse. Now what exactly will the meta verse be? Well, the honest answer is we don’t know yet. We have an idea of what it can be, but just like the internet of the early 90’s nobody could predict exactly what it turned into 30 years later. The idea of the meta verse is to create a digital universe outside of our real lives, through virtual reality, augmented reality, live in digital land and become digital avatars. Think of the movie ready player one - its a crazy idea to think about but then again so was all future technologies at some point. The idea is to understand and take advantage of these things at the ground level - so the first thing I would do is solidify my investment into the meta verse by looking at companies and stocks that will someway take part in it. Now sure you can invest in NFTs and buy digital land and things like that but those are long shots - some might put them into the speculation category - and that’s fine - but if we are talking about solid investments we might want to just start with some good ol’ solid stocks so here are a few I’m looking into..(top stocks in the video)<br /><br />My next investment which is another factor in the economy that we can take advantage of and that’s rising interest rates. With inflation rising to record highs of which we haven’t seen in decades, many experts agree that the Fed will need to start raising interest rates over the next few years in efforts to lower the inflation and stabilize the economy. So what happens when interest rates increase? Consumers and business have less money to spend - which will cause demand for goods and services to decrease. So who increases the money they make during this time? Well, the ones who lend out money at a higher rate - the banks. Banks make money from the loans they provide - meanwhile paying almost nothing back to you for saving your cash - which again people will do,  so the idea is if banks will start making even more money, their stocks will be a good investment especially for 2022. (Top bank stocks in the video)<br /><br />We have a record low amount of inventory in the United States while real estate prices have hit record highs. Active home listing fell by 25% since 2020 and more than 40% since 2019 while the average home price hit a new all-time high of upwards of $360,000 which is up 14% since 2020 and up 30% since 2019. Almost half of the homes that go up for sale sell within 1-2 weeks and we are seeing homes sell for above asking price. So what does this all mean and how can we take advantage of the macroeconomics of the situation. Well like we spoke about before, inflation hit us in a big way this year - and even though a lot of the inflation is seen right now in consumer goods - asset prices like homes can also inflate due to the increase inflation. So I don’t think we’ll see a big decline in 2022 in home prices even if interest rates increase because of the huge demand that we are seeing for real estate.</p>
